information and technical analysis with the help of charts and tables.
2.
the annual statement on monetary policy will be reviewed on a
quarterly basis during 2008-09, whereas the annual statement on
developmental and regulatory policies will be reviewed along with the
mid-term review of monetary policy, in continuation of the changes in the
institutional framework of policy formulation that were initiated in 2005-06.
accordingly, the dates for the first quarter review and the mid-term review
are july 29, 2008 and october 24, 2008, respectively.

i. review of macroeconomic and monetary
developments during 2007-08
domestic developments
4.
the growth of real gross domestic product (gdp) in 2007-08 was placed
at 8.7 per cent by the central statistical organisation (cso) in its advance
estimates released in february 2008. economic activity in 2007-08 has evolved
in consonance with policy expectations set out in april 2007, albeit with some
moderation as compared with 9.6 per cent in 2006-07. in retrospect, the
slackening of momentum in 2007-08 appears to have set in as anticipated and
moved gradually over the four quarters. real gdp growth was 9.3 per cent,
1

8.9 per cent, 8.4 per cent and 8.4 per cent, respectively, in the four quarters of
2007-08 as against 9.6 per cent, 10.1 per cent, 9.1 per cent and 9.7 per cent
in the corresponding quarters of 2006-07.
5.
real gdp originating in agriculture and allied activities is estimated to
have risen by 2.6 per cent in 2007-08, lower than 3.8 per cent in the previous
year. according to the third advance estimates of agricultural production
released by the ministry of agriculture in april 2008, total foodgrains production
is expected to increase to an all-time high of 227.3 million tonnes in 2007-08
from 217.3 million tonnes in 2006-07. kharif foodgrains production is expected
to have risen by 8.6 per cent, whereas rabi foodgrains production is expected
to increase by 0.5 per cent. output is estimated to have risen in the case of
rice (2.5 per cent), wheat (1.3 per cent), coarse cereals (17.0 per cent) and
pulses (7.0 per cent). among the commercial crops, production is estimated to
have increased under cotton (2.5 per cent), oilseeds (16.1 per cent) and jute
(2.3 per cent) whereas the production of sugarcane declined by 3.2 per cent.
6.
real gdp originating in industry rose by 8.6 per cent in 2007-08 as
compared with 10.6 per cent in the previous year. the index of industrial
production (iip) recorded an increase of 8.7 per cent during april-february
2007-08 vis-à-vis 11.2 per cent a year ago. in manufacturing, which contributed
89 per cent of the increase in industrial production, the growth of output was
lower at 9.1 per cent than 12.2 per cent a year ago. growth in mining at
5.1 per cent was comparable with 5.0 per cent a year ago, while growth in
electricity generation moderated to 6.6 per cent as compared with 7.2 per cent.
production of beverages, tobacco and related products, wood and wood
products, leather and leather products, basic chemicals and products and basic
metals and alloys recorded double-digit growth in 2007-08 (up to february
2008). the industry groups that registered deceleration of growth include
textiles, paper and paper products, non-metallic mineral products and transport
equipments and parts. on the other hand, the production of metal products
and parts except machinery and equipments recorded a decline.
7.
in terms of the use-based classification of industries, the production
of capital goods continued to expand at a sustained pace, increasing by
17.5 per cent during april-february 2007-08, over and above the increase of
18.3 per cent a year ago. the basic, intermediate and consumer non-durable
goods segments recorded lower growth of 7.4 per cent, 9.2 per cent and
8.9 per cent, respectively, as compared with 10.1 per cent, 11.7 per cent and
2

9.5 per cent a year ago. production of consumer durables declined by 1.0 per cent
as against an increase of 9.7 per cent a year ago. the output of the six key
infrastructure industries (with a weight of 26.7 per cent in the iip) also
registered a lower growth of 5.6 per cent during april-february 2007-08 as
against 8.7 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year.
8.
corporate activity experienced some moderation in growth relative to
the recent past but continued to remain healthy during 2007-08. during
april-december 2007, growth in sales of surveyed non-financial private
companies decelerated to 17.4 per cent from 29.1 per cent in the
corresponding period of the preceding year. net profits growth was also
lower at 29.8 per cent from 46.6 per cent a year ago due to a combination of
several factors including escalation in input costs and compensation to
employees. corporates' interest burden continues to be low with the interest
payment to gross profits ratio estimated at 11.8 per cent, 12.8 per cent and
15.3 per cent in the first three quarters of 2007-08 as against 18.1 per cent
and 13.4 per cent in 2005-06 and 2006-07, respectively, and an average of
43.7 per cent in 2000-05. the differential between sales and expenditure growth
shrank to 20 basis points from 280 basis points in april-december 2006,
reflecting pressure on profits at the operating level, somewhat mitigated by strong
support from income from non-core activities which rose by 75.5 per cent in
april-december 2007 as compared with 20.9 per cent a year ago. early results
for the fourth quarter of 2007-08 indicate that growth in sales and net profits
are lower than in the corresponding quarter a year ago. there was also a
larger increase in expenditure on both raw materials and compensation to
employees for the selected companies. consequently, the difference between
sales growth and the overall expenditure growth narrowed, resulting in lower
profitability both in gross and net terms.
9.
the reserve bank's industrial outlook survey conducted during february
2008 indicates a mixed picture in the business sentiment. with a pickup in demand
conditions (including exports), the assessment for january-march 2007-08 shows
an improvement over the expectation for the quarter in the previous round of
the survey. the business expectations index for april-june 2008 at 123.2 has
moved up from 118.6 recorded in the previous quarter, against the seasonal
decline, but is still lower than its level at 127.5 in the corresponding quarter of
the previous year. production, order book positions and capacity utilisation
growth are expected to pick up in relation to the previous quarter and increasing
number of respondent firms expect employment levels to go up. price pressures
3

are seen as rising mainly on the back of higher raw material costs. about
27 per cent of respondent firms expect to pass on the price increase to
customers in april-june 2008 as compared with 23 per cent in the
corresponding quarter of the previous year. while imports and exports are
expected to pick up in april-june 2008 as compared with the previous quarter,
the growth in exports would be lower than in the corresponding quarter of
2007-08. with nearly one in every four respondents perceiving higher profit
margins and more than 60 per cent expecting status quo, the optimism on
profit margins for april-june 2008 has improved in relation to january-march
2008, although it is still lower than in april-june 2007.
10. business confidence surveys conducted by other agencies convey a
somewhat tempered though overall positive outlook. one survey's business
optimism index indicates a sharp decline in the first quarter of 2008-09 with
respect to the previous quarter and a much sharper fall when compared to
april-june 2007, attributable to less optimistic sentiment in the services and
capital goods sectors. according to another survey, however, the overall
economic conditions for the next six months are seen to be positive, with
production closely following expectations of growth in domestic sales and a
clear upturn in import growth. seasonally adjusted purchasing managers'
indices reflect lower business sentiment for january-march 2008 with some
ebbing in relation to the previous quarter but still higher than a year ago. all
the surveys indicate sustained though somewhat slower growth of
manufacturing with firms trying to protect their profit margins through
improvement in productivity and by passing on cost increases into selling
prices. investment sentiment remains positive on expectations of improvement
in the financial position, order books and capacity utilisation.
11. real gdp originating in the services sector rose by 10.6 per cent during
2007-08 as compared with 11.2 per cent a year ago. activity in construction
and financing, insurance, real estate and business services sector expanded
by 9.6 per cent and 11.7 per cent, respectively, as compared with 12.0 per cent
and 13.9 per cent in 2006-07. the growth of trade, hotels and restaurants,
transport, storage and communication was 12.1 per cent in 2007-08, marginally
higher than 11.8 per cent in 2006-07. growth in community, social and personal
services at 7.0 per cent was comparable to 6.9 per cent in the previous year.
12. aggregate demand conditions in 2007-08 continued to be dominated
by investment spending as in recent years. the growth of real gross fixed
4

capital formation (gfcf) accelerated to 15.7 per cent from 15.1 per cent in
the previous year. real private final consumption expenditure (pfce) increased
by 6.8 per cent as compared with 7.1 per cent in 2006-07. in nominal terms,
pfce marginally declined to 55.5 per cent of gdp at current market prices
during 2007-08 from 55.8 in 2006-07 and 57.4 per cent in 2005-06. on the
other hand, gfcf increased to 34.6 per cent of gdp from 32.5 per cent in
2006-07 and 31.0 per cent in 2005-06.
13. the overall moderation in real sector activity was reflected in the
evolution of monetary and banking developments in 2007-08. non-food
credit extended by the scheduled commercial banks (scbs) increased by
22.3 per cent (rs.4,19,425 crore) as compared with 28.5 per cent (rs.4,18,282 crore)
in the previous year. the incremental non-food credit-deposit ratio for the
banking system declined to 72.3 per cent during 2007-08 from 83.2 per cent
in 2006-07, 109.3 per cent in 2005-06 and 130.0 per cent in 2004-05. food
credit of scbs declined by rs.2,121 crore in 2007-08 as against an increase
of rs.5,830 crore in the previous year.
14. provisional information on the sectoral deployment of bank credit
available up to february 2008 indicates, as anticipated, a gradual deceleration
over the year. on a year-on-year basis, credit to services sector recorded the
highest growth (28.4 per cent), followed by industry (25.9 per cent) and
agriculture sector (16.4 per cent). on the other hand, growth in personal loans
decelerated to 13.2 per cent (30.6 per cent). growth in housing and real estate
loans decelerated to 12.0 per cent (25.8 per cent) and 26.7 per cent (79.0 per cent),
respectively. within the industrial sector, there was a sizeable credit pick-up in respect
of infrastructure (42.1 per cent as against 28.2 per cent a year ago), food processing
(32.0 per cent as against 27.6 per cent) and engineering (26.2 per cent as against
18.1 per cent). there was moderation in credit growth to basic metals and metal
products (19.0 per cent as against 33.3 per cent), textiles (23.0 per cent as
against 35.5 per cent), petroleum (23.3 per cent as against 64.4 per cent) and
chemicals (13.9 per cent as against 19.2 per cent). credit to industry constituted
45.2 per cent of the total expansion in non-food bank credit up to february
2008, followed by services (29.8 per cent), personal loans (15.8 per cent) and
agriculture (9.2 per cent). the share of infrastructure in total credit to industry
increased from 20.5 per cent to 23.1 per cent. on the contrary, the share of
credit to metals, textiles, chemicals and petroleum declined from 12.4 per cent,
11.3 per cent, 8.3 per cent and 4.9 per cent, respectively, to 11.7 per cent,
11.1 per cent, 7.5 per cent and 4.8 per cent. priority sector advances grew by
5

16.9 per cent with a moderation in their share in outstanding gross bank credit
to 33.3 per cent in february 2008 from 34.7 per cent a year ago.
15. scbs' investments in bonds/debentures/shares of public sector
undertakings and the private corporate sector and commercial paper (cp)
increased by 14.2 per cent (rs.11,830 crore) during 2007-08 as compared
with an increase of 5.1 per cent (rs.4,081 crore) in the previous year. as a
result, the total flow of funds from scbs to the commercial sector, including nonslr investments, increased by 21.9 per cent (rs.4,31,256 crore) in 2007-08 as
against 27.3 per cent (rs.4,22,363 crore) in 2006-07. banks' investment in
instruments issued by mutual funds increased by rs.6,818 crore in 2007-08
as compared with rs.1,315 crore in 2006-07.
16. commercial banks' investment in government and other approved
securities increased by 22.9 per cent (rs.1,81,222 crore) during 2007-08
significantly higher than 10.3 per cent (rs.74,062 crore) in 2006-07.
accordingly, their stock of statutory liquidity ratio (slr) eligible securities
marginally increased to 27.4 per cent of the banking system's net demand and
time liabilities (ndtl) in march 2008 from 27.3 per cent in march 2007. bank's
holdings of slr securities in excess of the prescribed ratio of 25 per cent
amounted to rs.1,02,422 crore although several banks are operating their slr
portfolios close to the prescribed level. adjusted for collateral securities under
the liquidity adjustment facility (laf) and issuances under the market
stabilisation scheme (mss), banks' investment in slr-eligible securities would
amount to 23.7 per cent of ndtl.
17. aggregate deposits of scbs increased by 22.2 per cent (rs.5,80,208 crore)
during 2007-08 as compared with 23.8 per cent (rs.5,02,885 crore) in the
previous year. demand deposit growth at 20.2 per cent was higher than
17.9 per cent in 2006-07 but time deposit growth moderated to 22.6 per cent
from 25.1 per cent in the previous year. in addition to the mobilisation of
deposits, the banking sector's lendable resources were augmented substantially
by capital raised through public issues and innovative capital instruments
during 2007-08.
18. money supply (m3) increased by 20.7 per cent (rs.6,86,096 crore) in
2007-08 as compared with 21.5 per cent (rs.5,86,548 crore) in 2006-07. bank
credit to the commercial sector increased by 20.3 per cent (rs.4,32,574 crore)
in 2007-08 as compared with the increase of 25.8 per cent (rs.4,37,074 crore)
6

a year ago. net bank credit to government recorded an increase of rs.67,363 crore,
with increase in banks' investment of rs.1,83,338 crore in government
securities offset by a decline of rs.1,15,975 crore (net) in reserve bank's
credit to government. the large increase in net foreign exchange assets of the
reserve bank was reflected in the increase of 38.7 per cent (rs.3,53,118 crore)
in the banking sector's net foreign exchange assets.
19. reserve money increased by 30.9 per cent (rs.2,19,326 crore) during
2007-08 as compared with 23.7 per cent (rs.1,35,935 crore) in the previous
year. while currency in circulation rose by 17.2 per cent (rs.86,606 crore) in
2007-08 as compared with the increase of 17.1 per cent (rs.73,523 crore) in
the preceding year, bankers' deposits with the reserve bank increased
substantially by 66.5 per cent (rs.1,31,152 crore) _ augmented by the increase
of 150 basis points in cash reserve ratio (crr) during the year _ as compared
with the increase of 45.6 per cent (rs.61,784 crore) in 2006-07. among the
sources of reserve money, the reserve bank's foreign currency assets
(adjusted for revaluation) increased by rs.3,70,550 crore as compared with
the increase of rs.1,64,601 crore in the previous year. the reserve bank's
net credit to the central government (adjusted for the government's deposit
balances including the mss proceeds) declined by rs.7,070 crore in 2007-08
as against an increase of rs.30,888 crore in 2006-07. reflecting the liquidity
conditions, the reserve bank's credit to banks and the commercial sector
declined by rs.2,794 crore as compared with an increase of rs.1,990 crore
in the previous year. the ratio of net foreign exchange assets (nfea) to
currency increased from 171.8 per cent in march 2007 to 209.2 per cent in
march 2008.
20. during the year, the financial markets experienced alternating shifts in
liquidity conditions. tightness in liquidity on account of year-end adjustments
in march 2007 persisted up to april-may, necessitating net repo injections under
the laf. there was substantial drawdown in the centre's cash balances during
may-july 2007 and a dip in mss outstanding in june-july 2007 due to
redemptions. the total overhang of liquidity as reflected in the balances under
the laf, the mss and surplus cash balances of the central government taken
together declined from an average of rs.97,412 crore in march 2007 to
rs.63,994 crore in july 2007. the resumption of net issuances under the mss,
accretions to centre's cash balances and the increase in crr by 100 basis
points during august-november 2007 led to a reduction in the liquidity in the
banking system and intermittent net liquidity injections of rs.2,742 crore and
7

rs.10,804 crore on a daily average basis in november and december 2007,
respectively. auctions of dated securities under mss were discontinued
between november 2, 2007-january 16, 2008 to ease the stringency in
liquidity. the liquidity overhang ruled steady in the range of rs.2,13,847 crorers.2,18,224 crore during october-december 2007.
21. during the fourth quarter of 2007-08, even though liquidity conditions
were comfortable in january 2008 and mss auctions were resumed in
mid-january 2008, some tightness emerged during february 18-28, on account
of increase in the centre's cash balances. in view of the scheduled advance
tax payments in mid-march 2008 and the subsequent bank holidays (march
20-22, 2008), the reserve bank conducted additional three-day repo/reverse
repo auctions on march 14, 2008 (afternoon) and another seven-day repo
auction on march 17, 2008 (afternoon) over and above the normal laf
arrangements for smooth liquidity management. injection of liquidity through
laf repo and redemption of mss around mid-february 2008 onwards,
mitigated the liquidity tightness. during march 17-31, 2008 there were shortages
of liquidity in the wake of advance tax payments. net laf injections rose to a
peak of rs.53,995 crore on march 31, 2008; however, in the additional laf
operations conducted on that day with a view to meeting the banking sector's
year-end liquidity management requirements, there was absorption of liquidity
under the laf to the tune of rs.3,645 crore. the build-up of cash balances
of the central government to a peak of rs.1,04,741 crore on march 27, 2008
also aggravated the liquidity shortage with banks. the overall liquidity overhang
increased to the intra-year peak of rs.2,73,694 crore on march 27, 2008 before
declining to rs.2,43,879 crore on april 25, 2008.
22. on a net basis, average daily laf repo injections which stood at
rs.4,568 crore in the first quarter of 2007-08 changed to net absorption through
laf reverse repo of rs.13,472 crore in the second quarter which declined
sharply to rs.7,820 crore in the third quarter and further to rs.2,116 crore
during the fourth quarter of 2007-08. during 2008-09 (up to april 25, 2008),
the average daily net absorption under laf reverse repo increased to
rs.28,271 crore. the average outstanding balances under mss increased from
rs.64,863 crore at end-march 2007 to rs.1,70,554 crore by end-march 2008
and further to rs.1,74,465 crore on april 25, 2008 indicating net issuance of
rs.1,05,691 crore during 2007-08. cash balances of the central government
with the reserve bank increased from an average of rs.55,890 crore in march
2007 to rs.79,409 crore in march 2008 before declining to rs.36,649 crore
as on april 25, 2008.
8

23. on a year-on-year basis, inflation based on the wholesale price index
(wpi) stood at 7.4 per cent at end-march 2008 as compared with 5.9 per cent
a year ago. during 2007-08, headline inflation declined from 6.4 per cent at
the beginning of the financial year to a low of 3.1 per cent in mid-october
before firming up from mid-february 2008 onwards. on an annual average
basis, inflation at 4.7 per cent during 2007-08 was lower than 5.4 per cent in the
previous year. as on april 12, 2008 the headline inflation stood at 7.3 per cent as
against 6.3 per cent a year ago.
24. at a disaggregated level, prices of primary articles (weight: 22.0 per cent
in the wpi basket) registered a year-on-year increase of 8.9 per cent at
end-march 2008 as compared with 10.7 per cent a year ago. the increase in
prices of primary articles during 2007-08 was led by the rise in prices of food
articles and non-food articles such as cotton and oilseeds. as on february 1,
2008 the stock of foodgrains with public agencies stood at 21.4 million tonnes
as against the buffer stock norm of 20.0 million tonnes applicable for januarymarch, 2008. the build-up in food stocks on the back of the jump in foodgrains
production during 2007-08 provides some comfort for supply management.
wheat procurement during the current rabi marketing season has also risen
by 20.6 per cent on a year-on-year basis, strengthening food security strategies
and conditions for stabilisation of domestic food prices going forward.
25. inflation in terms of prices of manufactured products (weight: 63.8 per cent)
was 7.1 per cent as compared with 6.1 per cent a year ago. prices of edible
oils, oil cakes, basic metals, alloys and metal products and basic heavy
inorganic chemicals contributed to the rise in manufacturing prices in 200708. on the other hand, prices of textiles, leather and leather products and
non-ferrous metals declined during the year.
26. the year-on-year increase in prices of the 'fuel, power, light and
lubricants' group (weight: 14.2 per cent) was 6.7 per cent at end-march 2008
as compared )with 1.0 per cent a year ago. excluding the fuel group, headline
inflation was 7.6 per cent (7.4 per cent a year ago). the average price of the
indian basket of international crude increased by 27.6 per cent from us $ 62.4
per barrel during 2006-07 to us $ 79.7 per barrel in 2007-08. while there has
been no revision in prices of kerosene and domestic lpg during 2007-08,
domestic retail prices of petrol and diesel have been revised upwards only
once during 2007-08 with effect from february 15, 2008 by 4.5 per cent for
petrol and by 3.25 per cent for diesel (average of four metros). among the
9

freely priced petroleum products, however, prices of naptha, bitumen, furnace
oil and aviation turbine fuel, recorded increases of 33.7 per cent, 36.4 per cent,
37.6 per cent and 38.7 per cent, respectively, over their levels a year ago.
27. inflation, on a year-on-year basis, based on the consumer price index
(cpi) for industrial workers (iw) stood at 5.5 per cent in february 2008 as
compared with 7.6 per cent a year ago. the cpi for urban non-manual
employees (unme), agricultural labourers (al) and rural labourers (rl) also
declined to 6.0 per cent, 7.9 per cent and 7.6 per cent, respectively, in march
2008 as compared with 7.6 per cent, 9.5 per cent and 9.2 per cent a year ago.
on an annual average basis, inflation based on cpi for iw was 6.1 per cent in
february 2008 compared with 6.6 per cent a year ago and that for unme,
al and rl were 5.9 per cent, 7.5 per cent and 7.2 per cent, respectively, in
march 2008 as compared with 6.6 per cent, 7.8 per cent and 7.5 per cent a
year ago.
28. the revised estimates (re) of the central government's finances for
2007-08 indicate ongoing improvement in the fiscal position and lowering of
the key deficit indicators relative to budget estimates (be). the revenue deficit
estimated at 1.4 per cent of gdp (rs.63,488 crore) was lower than 1.5 per cent
of gdp in the be for 2007-08 and 1.9 per cent of gdp in 2006-07. the gross
fiscal deficit (gfd) for 2007-08 constituted 3.1 per cent of gdp (rs.1,43,653
crore) as against the budget estimates of 3.3 per cent and 3.5 per cent in
2006-07. the improvement in key fiscal indicators was largely enabled by
the sustained buoyancy in tax revenue which, at rs.4,31,773 crore (re) was
6.9 per cent higher than the budget estimates and recorded a growth of
22.9 per cent over the previous year.
29. during 2007-08, the central government's net market borrowing through
dated securities at rs.1,10,671 crore was 101.0 per cent of the budgeted
amount of rs.1,09,579 crore and gross market borrowing of rs.1,56,000
crore through dated securities was 100.35 per cent of the budgeted amount
of rs.1,55,455 crore. the central government also issued additional
securities amounting to rs.38,050 crore, outside the market borrowing
programme and the mss, to public sector oil companies for partial
compensation of under-recoveries, to the state bank of india and to
various fertiliser companies. during 2006-07, the central government had
issued such securities amounting to rs.40,321 crore. the state governments
and the union territory of pondicherry raised rs.67,779 crore (gross) and
10

rs.56,224 crore (net) during 2007-08 under their market borrowing programme.
the combined issuance (net) of government securities under the market
borrowing programme of the centre and states was rs.1,66,895 crore in
2007-08 as against rs.1,21,190 crore in 2006-07, rs.1,10,825 crore in
2005-06, rs.80,012 crore in 2004-05 and rs.1,35,192 crore in 2003-04.
30. out of 35 issuances under the market borrowing programme of the
central government, one new 10-year paper was issued and the remaining
34 issues were reissuances intended to impart liquidity. the actual issuance
of dated securities under the centre's market borrowing programme was
generally as per the advance calendar except for one occasion when, in
consultation with the central government, securities for rs.5,000 crore were
issued on june 12, 2007 over and above the scheduled issuances in the
indicative calendar for the first half of 2007-08. the weighted average yield
on primary issuance of the central government's dated securities increased
by 23 basis points to 8.12 per cent in 2007-08 from 7.89 per cent in the previous
year whereas the weighted average maturity of the dated securities issued
during the year increased to 14.90 years from 14.72 years in the previous
year. in the case of market borrowing by state governments, the weighted
average yields firmed up by 15 basis points to 8.25 per cent in 2007-08 from
8.10 per cent in 2006-07, whereas the average maturity of these issues has
remained the same at 10.0 years.
31. movements in interest rates in the domestic financial markets reflected
the factors driving changes in liquidity with the banking system during 2007-08.
the weighted average call market rates declined from 8.33 per cent in april 2007
to 0.73 per cent in july 2007 coincident with a ceiling of rs.3,000 crore placed
on daily reverse repo from march 5, 2007. the rates moved up in august
following the removal of the ceiling but generally stayed within the informal
laf rate corridor up to december 2007. as liquidity conditions tightened, call
money rates strayed, albeit marginally, above the repo rate during the last
fortnight of february and in march 2008. the daily weighted average call
rate during march 2008 was much lower at 7.37 per cent as compared with
14.10 per cent in march 2007. in april 2008, call rates declined further and
the weighted average call rate stood at 5.93 per cent as on april 25, 2008.
interest rates in the cblo and market repo segments moved in sympathy
with call rates and declined from december 2007 peaks to 6.37 per cent
and 6.72 per cent, respectively, in march 2008 and further to 4.93 per cent
11

and 5.45 per cent in april 2008 (up to april 25, 2008). the daily average
volume (one leg) in the call money market declined from rs.14,845 crore in
april 2007 to rs.11,182 crore in march 2008 and further to rs.9,374 crore in
april 2008 (up to april 25, 2008). the corresponding volumes in the market
repo (outside the laf) were rs.7,173 crore, rs.14,800 crore and rs.11,911
crore respectively, whereas in the cblo segment, the volumes were rs.18,086
crore, rs.37,413 crore and rs.31,297 crore, respectively.
32. mobilisation of resources through issuance of commercial papers (cps)
was stepped up during 2007-08 as the weighted average discount rate on cp
declined by 95 basis points from 11.33 per cent at end-march 2007 to 10.38
per cent in end-march 2008 and the outstanding amount of cps increased
from rs.17,688 crore to rs.32,592 crore during this period. the weighted
average discount rate for certificates of deposit (cds) also declined from
10.75 per cent at end-march 2007 to 10.00 per cent in end-march 2008,
accompanied by a significant increase in outstanding amounts from rs.93,272
crore to rs.1,47,792 crore.
33. in the government securities market, primary market yields of 91-day,
182-day and 364-day treasury bills softened over the course of 2007-08,
declining by 63-84 basis points to reach 7.23 per cent, 7.36 per cent and 7.35
per cent, respectively, by end-march 2008. by april 25, 2008 the primary market
yields of 91-day, 182-day and 364-day treasury bills stood at 7.44 per cent,
7.60 per cent and 7.69 per cent, respectively. in the secondary market, the
yield on government securities with 1-year residual maturity declined from
7.55 per cent at end-march 2007 to 7.49 per cent in march 2008 before
increasing to 7.84 per cent as on april 25, 2008. the yield on government
securities with 10-year residual maturity declined marginally from 7.97 per cent
in march 2007 to 7.93 per cent before rising to 8.23 per cent by april 25, 2008
while the yield on government securities with 20-year residual maturity
increased from 8.23 per cent at end-march 2007 to 8.31 per cent at end-march
2008 and further to 8.63 per cent as on april 25, 2008. consequently, the
yield spread between 10-year and 1-year government securities increased
marginally from 42 basis points at end-march 2007 to 44 basis points at
end-march 2008 before declining to 39 basis points as on april 25, 2008.
similarly, the yield spread between 20-year and 1-year government
securities increased from 68 basis points at end-march 2007 to 82 basis
points at end-march 2008 and subsequently declined marginally to 79 basis
points as on april 25, 2008.
12

34. rapid growth in turnover in the foreign exchange market was sustained
by large surplus conditions in the spot market. the average daily turnover
increased to us $ 57.30 billion at end-march 2008 from us $ 33.18 billion at
end-march 2007. with increasing volumes of current and capital account
transactions, the merchant turnover for the period increased to us $ 16.37 billion
from us $ 8.66 billion, while the inter-bank turnover increased to us $ 40.88
billion from us $ 24.52 billion. there was a general softening in forward
premia across all maturities over end-march 2007 but some hardening was
witnessed after september 2007. the six-month forward premia eased from
4.40 per cent in march 2007 to 2.55 per cent by end-june 2007 and further to
0.78 per cent by end-september before it increased to 2.50 per cent at end-march
2008 and further to 2.67 per cent by april 25, 2008.
35. during march 2007-march 2008, pubic sector banks (psbs) readjusted
their deposit rates downwards by 25-50 basis points, while those offering
lower deposit rates for similar maturity earlier increased their deposit rates
by 50-100 basis points. similarly, psbs paying higher interest rates earlier on
shorter term deposits of up to one year maturity also revised their deposit rates
downwards by 25 basis points. in particular, the interest rates offered by the
psbs on deposits of above one year maturity moved from the range of
7.25-9.50 per cent in march 2007 to 8.00-9.25 per cent in march 2008, while
deposit rates for shorter term deposits of up to one year maturity decreased
from the range of 2.75-8.75 per cent to 2.75-8.50 per cent during the same
period. on the other hand, private sector banks increased their interest rates
for long term deposits of above one year maturity from a range of 6.75-9.75
per cent to 7.25-9.75 per cent during the same period. foreign banks set
deposit rates lower for maturities of less than one year while they have
marginally raised their rates for deposits of longer maturities.
36. on the lending side, the benchmark prime lending rates (bplrs) of
psbs increased by 75 basis points from a range of 12.25-12.75 per cent to
12.25-13.50 per cent during 2007-08. the private sector banks increased their
bplr from a range of 12.00-16.50 per cent to a range of 13.00-16.50 per cent,
in the same period. the range of bplrs for foreign banks, however, remained
unchanged at 10.00-15.50 per cent during the same period. the median
lending rates for term loans (at which maximum business is contracted) in
respect of psbs moved from a range of 9.13-12.50 per cent in march 2007
to 10.00-13.00 per cent by march 2008.
13

37. the indian equity market witnessed large swings during 2007-08. the
bse sensex (1978-79=100) increased by 19.7 per cent during the year from
13072 at end-march 2007 to 15644 at end-march 2008. the intra-year peak
of 20873 was recorded on january 8, 2008 whereas the intra-year trough of
12445 was recorded on april 2, 2007. corporates mobilised large resources
through public issues during the year. sound macroeconomic fundamentals,
private corporate profitability, institutional buying support and global
macroeconomic conditions were the major factors determining the movements
in equity prices. as on april 25, 2008 the bse sensex stood at 17126.
developments in the external sector
38. the reserve bank's end-march 2008 release sets out the balance of
payments data for april-december 2007. in us dollar terms, merchandise exports
increased by 24.6 per cent during april-december 2007 from 23.9 per cent in
april-december 2006. provisional information on commodity-wise trade
available from the directorate general of commercial intelligence and statistics
(dgci&s) shows that export growth in 2007-08 was driven by petroleum
products, engineering goods and gems and jewellery. during the first nine
months of 2007-08, merchandise import growth accelerated to 27.9 per cent
from 27.7 per cent a year ago, mainly due to an increase of 29.9 per cent in
non-oil imports from 22.7 per cent in april-december 2006. the growth in
non-oil imports was mainly due to capital goods, pearls and precious stones,
chemicals, and gold and silver. oil imports increased by 24.0 per cent as
against 39.4 per cent during april-december 2006 as the average price of the
indian basket of international crude recorded an annual increase of 15.9 per cent
to us $ 74.7 per barrel in april-december 2007. on payments basis, the
merchandise trade deficit increased to us $ 66.5 billion during april-december
2007 from us $ 50.3 billion in the corresponding period of 2006-07.
39. net invisible earnings amounted to us $ 50.5 billion in april-december
2007 as against us $ 36.3 billion a year ago. the key contributors to invisibles
were remittances from indians working overseas, export of software services
and travel earnings. private transfers, comprising primarily remittances from
overseas indians, remained sizeable at us $ 28.8 billion as compared with
us $ 20.2 billion a year ago. while the inward remittances for family
maintenance increased by 39.0 per cent, local withdrawals from non-resident
indian (nri) deposit accounts were higher by 49.0 per cent which may be
attributed to higher returns domestically vis-à-vis nri deposits. software export
14

proceeds amounted to us $ 27.5 billion as against us $ 21.8 billion in
april-december 2006. miscellaneous receipts, net of software exports, stood
at us $ 18.1 billion in april-december 2007 as compared with us $ 17.6 billion
a year ago, mainly on account of business services such as trade-related
services, business and management consultancy, engineering and technical
know-how. invisible payments increased to us $ 49.7 billion during the first
nine months of 2007-08 as compared with us $ 43.1 billion a year ago. the
key components of invisible payments were travel payments, transportation,
business and management consultancy, technical services, dividends, profit
and interest payments. with invisible receipts rising faster than payments, the
net invisible surplus increased from us $ 36.3 billion in april-december 2006
to us $ 50.5 billion in april-december 2007. reflecting these developments
in the merchandise and invisible accounts, the current account deficit (cad)
at us $ 16.0 billion was higher than us $ 14.0 billion in the corresponding
period of the previous year.
40. net capital inflows surged by 172 per cent to us $ 81.9 billion during
april-december 2007 as compared with us $ 30.1 billion a year ago.
while net foreign direct investment (fdi) increased by us $ 8.4 billion
from us $ 7.6 billion in april-december 2006, portfolio investment recorded
a substantial increase of us $ 33.0 billion from us $ 5.2 billion. enabled by
finer spreads and in response to rising financing requirements for domestic
capacity expansion, net external commercial borrowings (ecbs) increased to
us $ 16.3 billion as against an increase of us $ 9.8 billion in the previous
year. during the first nine months of 2007-08, nri deposits registered a net
outflow of us $ 0.9 billion as against an increase of us $ 3.7 billion in
april-december 2006, responding to the reduction in the ceiling on
interest rate on nri deposits in april 2007. net short-term trade credit
rose to us $ 10.8 billion as compared with us $ 5.7 billion a year ago. on
the whole, debt flows (net) in the form of external assistance, ecbs, nri
deposits and short-term credit put together increased to us $ 27.5 billion in
april-december 2007 from us $ 20.2 billion a year ago.
41. there was a large accretion of us $ 67.2 billion to foreign exchange
reserves, excluding valuation changes, during april-december 2007 as
against us $ 16.2 billion in april-december 2006. valuation gains, reflecting
the appreciation of major currencies against the us dollar, accounted for
us $ 8.9 billion of the total accretion to the reserves during april-december
2007. including these valuation effects, the foreign exchange reserves recorded
15

an increase of us $ 76.1 billion and rose to reach a level of us $ 275.3 billion
by end-december 2007. india's external debt increased by us $ 31.8 billion
from end-march 2007 to us $ 201.4 billion at end-december 2007. the
increase was mainly under ecbs (us $ 15.3 billion) and short-term credit
(us $ 8.8 billion). valuation changes due to the depreciation of the us dollar
vis-à-vis major international currencies and the indian rupee, accounted for
us $ 6.0 billion of the increase in external debt during the period. in the total
external debt stock, ecbs accounted for the highest share (28.3 per cent),
followed by nri deposits (21.4 per cent), multilateral debt (18.8 per cent) and
bilateral debt (8.6 per cent). at end-2007, the ratio of short-term debt to total
debt was 17.5 per cent. the share of us dollar_denominated debt in total
debt was highest at 54.5 per cent, followed by 17.1 per cent in
rupee_denominated debt and 11.2 per cent in japanese yen_denominated debt.
42. information available for subsequent months from the dgci&s indicates
that merchandise exports increased by 22.8 per cent in us dollar terms during
april-february 2007-08 as compared with 23.2 per cent in the corresponding
period of the previous year. on the other hand, imports showed an increase
of 30.1 per cent as compared with 25.2 per cent. while the increase in oil
imports was lower at 26.4 per cent as compared with 31.2 per cent, non-oil
import recorded a higher growth of 31.8 per cent as compared with 22.6 per cent.
during april-february 2007-08, the trade deficit widened to us $ 72.5 billion
which was 46.8 per cent higher than the deficit of us $ 49.4 billion in the
corresponding period of the previous year.
43. the sustained strength of capital flows during the year is noteworthy. net
portfolio flows on account of investments by fiis surged to us $ 20.3 billion in
2007-08 from us $ 3.2 billion in the previous year. net inflows in the form of
fdi rose to us $ 25.5 billion in april-february 2007-08 from us $ 19.6 billion
a year ago. net inflows under adrs/gdrs increased to us $ 8.7 billion from
us $ 3.8 billion. on the other hand, net accretions to nri deposits amounted
to us $ 0.1 billion as against us $ 3.9 billion. during 2007-08, the foreign
exchange reserves increased by us $ 110.5 billion to us $ 309.7 billion by
end-march 2008 and stood at us $ 313.5 billion as on april 18, 2008.
44. the indian foreign exchange market witnessed generally orderly
conditions during 2007-08 with the exchange rate exhibiting two-way
movements. the exchange rate of the rupee against the us dollar, which
was rs.43.59 at end-march 2007 appreciated by 5.6 per cent to rs.41.29 at
16

end-april 2007 and further to rs.39.27 by january 8, 2008. in the subsequent
period the exchange rate depreciated, easing to rs.39.97 per us dollar by
end-march 2008. the rupee-euro exchange rate depreciated from rs.58.14 at
end-march 2007 to rs.63.09 by end-march 2008. overall, during 2007-08, the
rupee appreciated by 9.1 per cent against the us dollar and by 7.5 per cent
against pound sterling but depreciated by 7.7 per cent against the japanese
yen, and by 7.8 per cent against the euro. as on april 25, 2008 the exchange
rate of the rupee was rs.40.18 per us dollar, rs.62.90 per euro, rs.79.25
per pound sterling and rs.38.47 per 100 japanese yen.
45. the exchange rate policy in recent years has been guided by the broad
principles of careful monitoring and management of exchange rates with
flexibility, without a fixed target or a pre-announced target or a band, coupled
with the ability to intervene, if and when necessary. the overall approach to
the management of india's foreign exchange reserves takes into account the
changing composition of the balance of payments and endeavours to reflect
the 'liquidity risks' associated with different types of flows and other
requirements.
developments in the global economy
46. global economic activity decelerated somewhat in relation to earlier
expectations, mainly on account of the slowdown in the us economy. during
the first quarter of 2008, the unfolding of the subprime mortgage crisis coupled
with growing concerns about a contraction of economic activity in the us in
2008 appears to be feeding into a deterioration in the outlook for global growth
which has remained relatively resilient so far. there are some signs that the
slowdown in the us may spill over to the euro area, china and japan with
potential implications for the emerging market economies (emes) through trade,
financial markets and other linkages. according to the world economic outlook
(weo) of the international monetary fund (imf) released in april 2008, the
forecast for global real gdp growth, on a purchasing power parity basis, is
expected to slow from 4.9 per cent in 2007 to 3.7 per cent in 2008 _ as
compared with the projection of 4.1 per cent published in january 2008 _ and
3.8 per cent in 2009. world real gdp growth, on the basis of market exchange
rates, is estimated to decelerate from 3.7 per cent in 2007 to 2.6 per cent in
2008 and 2009.
47. in the us, real gdp grew by 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2007
as compared with 2.1 per cent a year ago and 4.9 per cent in the previous
17

quarter. in the first quarter of 2008, labour markets weakened with the
unemployment rate rising to 5.1 per cent in march 2008. household and
consumption demand is likely to be affected with home prices having fallen
by 10.7 per cent in the year ending january 2008, bank seizures having more
than doubled in march 2008 over the level a year ago and the year-on-year
monthly foreclosure continuing to increase in march 2008 for the 27th
consecutive month. us real gdp growth is expected to slow further during
2008 as the housing market downturn deepens and the financial market turmoil
spreads across the financial system with macroeconomic implications as
apprehended by the imf in its april 2008 global financial stability report.
the index of leading indicators increased marginally in march after a
continuous decline up to february 2008. however, consumer sentiment was
at its lowest level in 26 years in april 2008. the us economy is expected to
show some improvement in the second half of 2008, when tax rebates in the
fiscal stimulus package could lift growth. the imf's april 2008 update of its
weo expects the us economy to grow at a slower pace of 0.5 per cent in
2008 as against 2.2 per cent in 2007, but projects some recovery to 0.6 per cent
in 2009.
48. real gdp in the euro area grew by 2.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of
2007 on a year-on-year basis as compared with 3.3 per cent a year ago. real
activity appears to have strengthened in the first quarter of 2008.
unemployment fell in january-february 2008 to a record low of 7.1 per cent
notwithstanding currency appreciation, surging oil prices and the us slowdown.
growth in european service industries has accelerated above projections with
optimism on export prospects. however, european retail sales fell in march
after rising for the first time in five months in february. retailers continue to
lack pricing power with consumer spending held down by inflation at its highest
level in 14 years. the april 2008 update of the imf's weo has placed real
gdp growth of the euro area at 1.4 per cent in 2008 and 1.2 per cent in 2009
as against 2.6 per cent in 2007.
49. the japanese economy grew by 3.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of
2007 as compared with 2.2 per cent a year ago. in the first quarter of 2008,
lead indicators point to some slackening of momentum while consumer and
business sentiment has weakened. japan's factory production fell in
january-february 2008 as a deepening us slowdown weakened demand for
cars and electronics. exports and production are slowing and wages remain
subdued. consumer sentiment in japan has been worsening with higher crude
18

oil prices and the rising prices of daily necessities. the april 2008 weo of
the imf has projected that japan's economy, the world's second largest, will
grow by 1.4 per cent in 2008 and by 1.5 per cent in 2009 as compared with
the estimated growth of 2.1 per cent in 2007.
50. these unusual developments in global economy indicate heightened
uncertainties and emerging challenges for the conduct of monetary policy,
especially for emes. the imf has forecast that the emerging and developing
economies’ growth will slow to 6.7 per cent in 2008 from 7.9 per cent in 2007
and further to 6.6 per cent in 2009. developing asia will slow by 1.5 percentage
points to a still-rapid 8.2 per cent. however, downside risks are emerging to
the extent emes' growth has depended heavily on external demand and also
due to the possibility of capital inflows drying up in the present risk-averse
scenario. rise in risk aversion has already dampened private bond issuance
in several emes. most importantly, inflation has raised its head in several
emes and this might complicate monetary policy decision-making even further,
particularly in view of the greater weight for food in consumer prices as well
as inflation perceptions in emes.
51. the chinese economy grew by 11.9 per cent in 2007 as compared with
11.1 per cent in 2006 in spite of measures to cool down the pace of growth,
including reduction of export rebates and restrictions on processing exports. in
the first quarter of 2008, however, growth has moderated to 10.6 per cent as
compared with 11.7 per cent a year ago. reflecting the slowdown in export
growth, china's trade surplus fell year-on-year by 10.8 per cent in march 2008
to us $13.4 billion. the total foreign exchange reserves, however, increased
to us $ 1.7 trillion in march 2008 as compared with us $ 1.2 trillion in march
2007. in 2008, the chinese economy is expected to moderate to a growth of
9.3 per cent as tightening policies take effect. the csi 300 index, which tracks
yuan-denominated a shares listed on china's two exchanges, has fallen by
28.8 per cent to 3803.1 on april 25, 2008 after increasing six-fold in the two
years through 2007. the chinese authorities are making efforts to resolve
problems such as overheated growth in fixed asset investment, excessive
supplies of money and credit and a huge trade surplus.
52. among other major asian economies, the korean economy grew by
5.0 per cent in 2007, decelerating marginally from 5.1 per cent in 2006 despite
higher exports to emerging markets such as china. economic activity is
expected to slow down further to 4.2 per cent in 2008 before accelerating to
19

4.4 per cent in 2009. in thailand, economic activity is expected to grow by
5.3 per cent in 2008 and further to 5.6 per cent in 2009 as against 4.8 per cent
in 2007, as stronger domestic demand growth and expansionary public
expenditures offset slowing export growth.
53. continuing strong demand and dwindling stocks are reflected in a tight
supply-demand food situation globally, leading to the emergence of food price
inflation as a key risk to global stability. the fao's global food price index,
which rose by 40 per cent in 2007 to the highest level on record, has continued
to increase in the first quarter of 2008 as well, as world food stocks have
fallen to their lowest levels in 25 years. food import bills in the low-income
food-deficit countries are likely to rise by 35 per cent for the second consecutive
year in 2008. shortages and high prices for all kinds of food have caused
social tensions around the world in recent months in haiti, indonesia, pakistan
and several african countries. china has imposed price controls on cooking
oil, grain, meat, milk and eggs. in egypt, the government has significantly
raised food subsidies and signed a bilateral agreement with kazakhstan for
1 million tonnes of wheat at a preferential price to be delivered during 2008.
indonesia has removed the 5 per cent duty on wheat import and suspended a
10 per cent duty on imported soybeans. in april 2008, the global food crisis
appears to have intensified with kazakhstan _ one of the world's biggest wheat
exporters _ curbing exports, alongside restrictions in russia, ukraine and
argentina. these curbs are likely to trigger similar moves in other foodgrain
exporting countries in the face of rising domestic prices worldwide.
54. in the global foodgrains market, prices of major crops such as corn,
soyabeans and wheat have increased by 58.2 per cent, 86.3 per cent and
56.5 per cent, respectively, by april 25, 2008 from a year ago in response to
surging demand. the increase in overall foodgrain prices has gained
momentum from higher energy and fertiliser prices, low levels of inventories,
shortfalls in certain crops mainly caused by weather-related factors such as
the ongoing drought in australia and strong increases in the demand for crops.
higher rice prices are also contributing to inflation in many developing countries
as the price of rice, a staple in the diets of nearly half the world's population,
has almost doubled on international markets in the last three months. drawing
down of costly stockpiles of rice in recent years has removed an effective
price dampener in the face of adverse demand-supply imbalances. rising
prices and a growing fear of scarcity have prompted some of the world's largest
rice producers _ india, vietnam, egypt and cambodia _ at end-march 2008 to
20

announce drastic limits on the amount of rice they export which have driven
prices on the world market even higher. philippines has started to track down
rice hoarders. rice prices in thailand have trebled over their level in the
beginning of 2008. with indonesia joining other major rice exporters in banning
exports, international near-month futures price of rice on chicago board of trade
(cbot) has risen to a high of us $ 23.8 per hundredweight on april 25, 2008 _
up by 71 per cent since january 2008. on the same day, futures prices were
quoted higher at us $ 24.18 for july 2008, but the quotes moderated for
september 2008 to us $ 22.09 and for may 2009 to us $ 22.38.
55. wheat prices remained generally firm and volatile since october 2007
on account of repeated downward revisions of production forecasts in a number
of major exporting countries, most notably australia. world wheat output is
now estimated to have risen by only 1.6 per cent in 2007. trade is expected
to contract because of high and volatile prices, coupled with soaring freight
rates. one month wheat futures at the cbot rose from us $ 9.15 per bushel
on january 2, 2008 to us $ 12.8 on february 27, 2008 before falling to
us $ 8.01 on april 25, 2008. on the same day, futures prices for wheat were
quoted higher for july 2008 at us $ 8.16, for december 2008 at us $ 8.49
and for may 2009 at us $ 8.68.
56. strong demand for animal feed as well as for ethanol is the main driver
in global coarse grain markets, but supply tightness in several exporting
countries is also providing support to prices. the futures prices of corn on
cbot, which had moderated somewhat up to july 2007, started moving up
thereafter and reached us $ 5.77 on april 25, 2008. on the same day, futures
prices for corn were quoted higher for july 2008 at us $ 5.90, for september
2008 at us $ 6.00 and for may 2009 at us $ 6.25.
57. metal prices have increased by 23.7 per cent during first three months
of 2008 after declining by 8.1 per cent during 2007 following increases of
53.6 per cent in 2006 and 36.3 per cent in 2005. in the futures markets,
aluminium, zinc and lead prices are showing a downward trend since october
2007. copper prices have been buoyed up by the depreciating us dollar and
high demand. futures price of copper on the new york mercantile exchange
(nymex) increased to a record level of us $ 4.03 per pound on april 9, 2008.
as on april 25, 2008 the may 2008 futures prices for copper which stood at us
$ 3.96 per pound were quoted lower for july 2008 at us $ 3.91, at us $ 3.89 for
september 2008 and at us $ 3.78 for may 2009. spot gold rose to us $ 1000.10
21

an ounce on march 13, 2008 _ the highest since january 1980 _ as the
dollar fell to a record low against the euro and on concerns about declining
supply on mine shutdowns in south africa, before declining to us $ 885.15
an ounce on april 25, 2008.
58. prices of crude oil, which have rebounded since july 2007, increased by
83.2 per cent up to april 25, 2008 from their level a year ago and near-month
futures prices have ruled at the record level of us $ 119.64 per barrel on
april 25, 2008 _ the highest since trading began on the nymex in 1983. on
the same day, oil futures ruled at a lower level of us $ 115.77 for september
2008 and us $ 114.06 for december 2008 and us $ 111.6 for may 2009.
according to the energy information administration (eia), tight fundamentals,
reflected by low available crude oil surplus production capacity, combined with
supply concerns in several oil exporting countries, have continued to put upward
pressure on world crude oil prices. the outlook over the next two years points
to some easing of the oil market balance due to increased production outside
of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries (opec) and planned
additions to opec capacity. however, delays to capacity additions in both
opec and non-opec nations could alter the outlook, as could opec
production decisions. according to the eia, the price of west texas
intermediate (wti) crude oil is expected to be at us $ 100.61 per barrel in
2008 and us $ 92.50 per barrel in 2009. surplus production capacity is
projected to decelerate from its current level of a little over 2 million barrels
per day (bbl/d) to more than 1 million bbl/d by the end of 2009.
59. in the us, consumer prices increased from 2.8 per cent in march 2007
to 4.0 per cent in march 2008. in the euro area, inflation increased to 3.6 per
cent in march 2008 _ the highest level since the introduction of the euro _
from 1.9 per cent a year ago. in japan, inflation increased to a decade-high
rate of 1.2 per cent in march 2008 from (-) 0.1 per cent a year ago on account
of rising oil and food costs. in the uk, cpi inflation decelerated to 2.5 per cent
in february-march 2008 from 2.8 per cent a year ago. at the retail level (in
terms of retail prices index or rpi), inflation rose to 4.8 per cent in the uk in
march 2007 _ the highest since 1991 _ but declined thereafter to 3.8 per cent in
march 2008 with some fluctuations in between. inflation pressures have also
raised concerns in some of the emes such as china, malaysia, indonesia
and chile.
60. core cpi inflation in the us increased to 2.4 per cent in march 2008
from 2.3 per cent in february 2008. in the uk, core cpi inflation has been
22

declining in tandem with the headline rate and stood at 1.2 per cent in
february-march, down from 1.3 per cent in january 2008. in the euro area,
core cpi inflation increased to 2.0 per cent in march 2008 from 1.8 per cent in
february 2008. core inflation in japan turned positive (0.1 per cent) in march
2008 as compared with _ 0.1 per cent in february 2008. the increase in
producer prices has been sharper than in consumer prices, reflecting increased
input costs. in the us, producer prices increased from 3.1 per cent in march
2007 to 6.9 per cent in march 2008. in the euro area, producer prices increased
from 2.8 per cent in march 2007 to 5.3 per cent in march 2008. in the uk,
producer prices increased to 6.2 per cent in march 2008 from 2.7 per cent in
march 2007. wholesale price inflation in japan increased from 1.2 per cent in
february 2007 to 3.4 per cent in february 2008. overall, the persistence of
high food and oil prices sustained at elevated levels and continued high prices
of other commodities pose significant inflation risks for the global economy
and challenges for monetary policy worldwide.
61. in the emes, the recent jump in headline inflation caused by higher
energy and food prices are of concern since this requires a balanced response
in controlling inflation while being alert to decelerating impulses from the
slowdown in the developed countries and the possibilities of a prolonged global
financial market turmoil. even though higher headline inflation may be driven
initially by rising food and energy prices, it could quickly lead to broader price
and wage pressures in the emes which are witnessing rapid growth. in china,
inflation accelerated to 8.7 per cent in february 2008 before easing to 8.3 per cent
in march as compared with 3.3 per cent in march 2007 despite the central
bank's repeated efforts to rein in inflation through monetary tightening policies.
at end-march 2008, the chinese state council decided to increase budgetary
subsidies for grain production and the government's minimum grain procurement
prices to address the potential shortfall in grain production. farmers' interest
in grain production has been declining as raw material costs were rising faster
than grain prices. consumer price inflation in korea accelerated to 3.9 per cent
in march 2008 from 2.2 per cent in march 2007 which is causing concern.
inflation increased to 5.3 per cent in march 2008 in thailand from 2.0 per cent
in march 2007.
62. concerns about a us slowdown and the uncertainty surrounding the
financial health of some of the biggest us financial entities have imparted
considerable volatility in the us equity markets since january 2008. on january
21, 2008 equity markets across the world experienced sharp declines with fall
23

in asian stocks as well. the volatility and bearishness in equity markets have
continued in february-april 2008 on account of weak us economic data and
substantial write-offs by financial institutions. the dow jones industrial average,
standard and poor's (s&p) 500 and nasdaq composite exhibited considerable
volatility and posted declines of 1.5 per cent, 6.5 per cent and 4.9 per cent,
respectively, by april 25, 2008 over their levels a year ago. in the fixed income
segment, government bond yields in the major economies, which had firmed
up in the first half of 2007, have softened thereafter since demand for
government debt has increased as investors shifted their funds to the treasuries
acknowledging the likelihood that the economy is already in a recession and
seeking safety. the us 10-year bond yield increased from 4.70 per cent at
end-december 2006 to 5.29 per cent on june 12, 2007 before falling to
3.87 per cent on april 25, 2008. the 10-year bond yield in the euro area
increased from 3.95 per cent at end-december 2006 to 4.68 per cent on
july 9, 2007 before falling to 4.18 per cent on april 25, 2008. the japanese
10-year bond yield has increased from 1.68 per cent at end-december 2006 to
1.97 per cent on june 13, 2007 before falling to 1.61 per cent on april 25, 2008.
these recent developments are indicative of evolving uncertainties in international
financial markets with implications for emes.
63. on a trade-weighted basis, the us dollar has been depreciating since
2006 with intermittent fluctuations. after the cuts in the fed funds rates since
september 2007, the us dollar has weakened against other currencies. the
pound sterling moved to the level of us $ 1.99 on april 25, 2008 _ close to
the 26-year high of us $ 2.11 reached on november 8, 2007 _ amidst
concerns relating to the us subprime mortgage market. the euro, which has
also been strengthening against the us dollar since june 2007, rose to
a peak of us $ 1.60 on april 22, 2008 before declining to us $ 1.56 on april
25, 2008. the canadian dollar appreciated against the us dollar to a 33-year
high to reach us $ 1.09 on november 6, 2007 before declining to us $ 1.01 on
april 25, 2008. turkey experienced a sharp appreciation in its currency visa-vis the us dollar to reach the level of 86.95 cents on january 10, 2008
before moving to 77.95 cents on april 25, 2008. the new zealand dollar
had appreciated to 81.10 cents to reach a 22-year peak against the us dollar
on july 24, 2007 before declining to 78.07 cents on april 25, 2008.
64. since the beginning of the turbulence in august 2007, central banks of
advanced economies have responded with both conventional and
unconventional measures to ease liquidity stress in financial markets and
24

solvency issues among large financial institutions. there has, however, been
several aspects that differentiate the approaches of the central banks. some
central banks, notably the ecb, the reserve bank of australia and the swiss
national bank have responded by providing liquidity to inter-bank markets,
implicitly viewing the financial turmoil as essentially a problem of liquidity
tightness. these central banks have provided liquidity through fine-tuning
operations aimed at assuring orderly conditions in their respective money
markets. on the other hand, some central banks like the us fed, the bank of
england and the bank of canada have responded in a more diverse fashion,
regarding the market stress as reflecting both liquidity seizure as well as
broader threats to financial stability, coupled with dangers of the slowdown in
economic activity becoming protracted. accordingly, they have moved to inject
liquidity into money markets through normal and special facilities. they have
also relaxed the class of eligible securities for liquidity availment from the
central bank. furthermore, they have also cut policy rates substantially amid
fears that the subprime crisis could turn into a major credit crunch with adverse
implications for the real sector. the us fed has also been involved in
resolution of problems arising in non-bank entities like investment banks and
insurance companies. the bank of england has provided generalised and
institution-specific emergency liquidity and facilities for swapping securities.
65. in the second phase of central bank intervention in december 2007 (the
first phase being spread over august-september), major central banks such
as the federal reserve, the bank of canada, the bank of england, the
european central bank and the swiss national bank (snb) injected liquidity
in a coordinated manner. actions taken by the federal reserve included the
establishment of a temporary term auction facility (taf) against a wide variety
of collateral that can be used to secure loans at the discount window; the
establishment of foreign exchange swap lines with the ecb and the snb which
will provide dollars in amounts of up to us $ 20 billion and us $ 6 billion to
the ecb and the snb, respectively, for use in their jurisdictions; a term
securities lending facility announced on march 11, 2008; and a primary
dealer credit facility (pdcf) on april 22, 2008. the fed has also conducted
nine auctions amounting to us $ 340 billion having 28-day maturity and an
auction of us $ 20 billion having 35-day maturity.
66. since december 2007, the ecb has conducted seven us dollar taf
auctions amounting to us $ 85 billion up to april 24, 2008 for 28 days maturity
each. the bank of canada has conducted five 28-day auctions amounting
25

to us $ 10 billion till april 17, 2008. the snb has conducted four auctions
amounting to us $ 20 billion for 28 days each up to april 22, 2008. the bank
of england increased liquidity injections from £2.85 billion to £11.35 billion for
its operations in december 2007-january 2008 of which £10 billion was offered
for 3-month maturity. it also announced that long term repo operations would
be held against a wider range of high quality collateral. in april 2008, the
bank of england launched a scheme to allow banks to swap temporarily their
high quality mortgage-backed and other securities for uk treasury bills. it
has so far allotted amounts of £44.9 billion (three months), £2.95 billion (six
months), £1.6 billion (nine months) and £ 0.8 billion (12 months) in four longterm repo auctions since december 2007.
67. some central banks have cut policy rates since the third quarter of 2007
when the financial market turmoil surfaced. during september 18, 2007 to march
18, 2008 the us federal reserve cut its policy rate by 300 basis points to
2.25 per cent after seventeen increases to 5.25 per cent between june 2004
and june 2006. the bank of england reduced its repo rate to 5.0 per cent by
25 basis points each in february and april 2008. the bank of canada reduced
its rate to 3.0 per cent by 25 basis points reductions each in december 2007
and january 2008 and 50 basis points each in march and april 2008. central
banks of several countries, including the euro area, new zealand, japan,
korea, malaysia, thailand and mexico have not changed their rates since the
last quarter of 2007. some central banks that have tightened their policy rates
in recent months include the reserve bank of australia (cash rate raised by
25 basis points in february-march 2008 to 7.25 per cent); the people's bank
of china (lending rate raised to 7.47 per cent in december 2007 from
7.29 per cent in september 2007); the banco central de chile (benchmark
lending rate raised to 6.25 per cent in january 2008 from 5.75 per cent in
october 2007), and banco central do brasil (overnight selic rate raised by
50 basis points to 11.75 per cent in april 2008).
68. large capital flows to emes have elicited various responses from central
banks for managing and stabilising these flows including monetary tightening
involving either hikes in policy rates or in reserve requirements or both. in
china, the required reserve ratio was raised from 8 per cent in july 2006 to
16.0 per cent on april 25, 2008. after a gap of 17 years, the bank of korea
raised reserve requirements from 5 per cent to 7 per cent for local currency
deposits and short-term foreign currency deposits in november and december
2006, respectively. meanwhile, in several emes including china and korea,
central bank bonds have continued to absorb liquidity from the banking system.
26

69. measures directly aimed at managing capital flows are also in evidence
in many emes. on december 18, 2006 thailand imposed unremunerated
reserve requirements (urr) of 30 per cent on most capital inflows, requiring
them to be deposited with the central bank for one year. however, with effect
from march 3, 2008 the bank of thailand has lifted the urr on short-term
capital inflows and said it would introduce three supporting measures to temper
the impact of the change. these measures involve (a) an increase in the foreign
investment limit to us $30 billion to allocate to securities companies, mutual
funds and individual investors, (b) an improvement in measures to prevent
baht speculation and (c) a revision to the structure of non-residential baht
accounts so as to help monitor fund flows of non-residents. in may 2007,
colombia introduced a package of measures, including a 40 per cent urr
on external borrowing to be held for six months in the central bank.
additionally, a new ceiling on the foreign exchange position of banks, including
gross positions in derivative markets, was stipulated to limit circumvention of
the urr and banks' exposure to counterparty risk. the pbc raised the amount
of foreign currencies that lenders must keep as reserves to 5 per cent from
4 per cent of their foreign-currency deposits from may 15, 2007. the bank of
korea is investigating large volume trading of currency forward contracts by
exporters and financial companies to limit gains in the won, which appreciated
to a 10-year high in 2007. chile and brazil's central bank have bought up
substantial amount of inflows from the spot market to add to reserves and
also conducted sizeable operations in the forward markets.
70. over the year gone by, global developments have brought forward
several new realities that pose severe challenges to monetary policy globally.
first, concerns relating to the us slowdown and its intensity have mounted in
view of the potential spillover on to the global economy. second, threats to
the global economy are emanating from advanced economies in sharp contrast
to earlier crises which stemmed from the emerging world. third, there are
indications that protectionist tendencies have increased around the world in
anticipation of the growing possibilities of slower growth in advanced
economies. in several key commodity-producing economies, policy measures
are in place and are being intensified to restrict the availability of supplies to
the international markets. fourth, linkages between financial sector
developments and the real sector have become more worrisome than before,
with apprehensions that financial turmoil may spillover to the real sector with
adverse implications for employment and growth. with financial institutions
reporting tightening in lending standards, deterioration in asset quality and
27

deceleration in consumer loan demand, there are signals that events in the
financial markets are beginning to have a persisting impact on other
dimensions of the real economy as well. fifth, higher and more volatile prices
of food, energy and other commodities have imparted a significant upside bias
to inflation and inflation expectations across the world, complicating the conduct
of monetary policy at a time of severe financial stress. in several countries,
there are threats to food availability with consequent social tensions. sixth,
terms-of-trade losses due to soaring commodity prices and exchange rate
appreciation are reducing the capacity of the euro area and japan to contribute
to a re-balancing of the world economy. seventh, emes are exhibiting
resilience so far in the face of the global financial turmoil reflecting relatively
stronger macroeconomic framework and sustainable macroeconomic balances.
thus, there is so far some divergence in terms of growth performance between
mature economies and emes but whether, how long and to what extent it will
persist is uncertain. on the other hand, inflationary pressures appear to be
common to mature economies and emes but the latter are under heavier
pressure.
71. there are several issues emerging out of recent financial developments
that are interacting with global macroeconomic changes and carry implications
for the conduct of monetary policy globally. first, financial markets are currently
at the heart of the turmoil and are regarded as sources of higher potential
instability going forward. despite sizeable central bank action over a wide
spectrum, market interest rates and policy rates continue to be widely divergent.
second, there are renewed concerns about the gaps in the financial
architecture and its limited capability for withstanding shocks or for preventing
spillovers. third, the effectiveness of financial regulations and supervision has
come under scrutiny, especially in the context of appropriately assessing capital
adequacy in large financial institutions, complex financial products and vehicles
and risk management practices. in this context, it is important to note that even
the basel ii and related processes are being reviewed in their granularities.
fourth, the role of credit rating agencies is being subjected to critical
reassessment, particularly in view of their envisaged role under basel ii. there
is active discussion on the need for credit rating agencies to clearly differentiate
the ratings for structured products, improve their disclosure of rating
methodologies, and assess the quality of information provided by originators,
arrangers, and issuers of structured products. fifth, current practices relating
to transparency and disclosure are being subject to careful appraisal in view
of their inadequacy in the context of structured financial products and special
28

purpose vehicles. sixth, the role of investment banks and their adequacy of
capital needs to be reviewed, along with stipulation of separate yet
complementary sets of best practices for hedge fund investors and asset
managers to increase accountability for participants in this industry.
overall assessment
72. while aggregate supply capacities expanded and alleviated domestic
macro-imbalances in 2007-08 to some extent, available indicators suggest that
economic activity in india currently continues to be mainly demand-driven. the
rate of gross fixed capital formation at current prices rose by 2.1 percentage
points of gdp at current market prices in 2007-08, more than compensating
for the decline of 0.3 percentage points in the rate of private final consumption
expenditure and that of 0.2 percentage points in the rate of government final
consumption expenditure. looking ahead, the union budget for 2008-09 is
likely to provide a stimulus to both private and government consumption in
view of the proposals for effective reduction of the tax burden under personal
income and excise as well as the revenue expenditure implications emanating
from the recommendations of the sixth pay commission. the dominance of
investment demand in the economy is likely to persist in 2008-09 and beyond,
supported as it were by the buoyancy in corporate saving in view of the
sustained resilience of sales and profitability, and the ongoing improvement in
public sector saving. furthermore, patterns of domestic industrial output and
imports remain skewed in favour of capital goods, indicative of ongoing
expansion in capacity, both new and existing. moreover, resources raised
through public issues as well as investment intentions more than doubled in
2007-08, pointing to the corporate sector's positive assessment of evolving
demand conditions and underlying plans for expanding production capacities.
finally, the sharp widening of the merchandise trade deficit reflects the spillover
of domestic demand into the external sector with implications for the year ahead.
73. the pick-up in inflation during the fourth quarter of 2007-08 has, however,
mainly emanated from supply-side pressures such as the one-off increase in
domestic petrol and diesel prices to partially offset the global crude oil price
increase over the year; continuous hardening of prices of petroleum products
that are not administered, rising prices of wheat and oilseeds and the
adjustment in steel prices in march 2008 due to the surge in international
prices. in recognition of the unanticipated supply-sided origin of pressures in
the recent months, partly due to global developments, the first response of
29

public policy to the hardening of inflation has been in terms of reducing import
duty on rice and edible oils, followed by a ban on exports of non-basmati rice
and pulses, an increase in the minimum export price relating to basmati rice,
reduction of customs duty on butter, ghee and maize, and administrative
measures to enable imposition of stock limits on selected agricultural products.
there are growing concerns that this upsurge in inflation in india has occurred
at a time when global commodity prices have been volatile at historically
elevated levels and central banks in mature and emerging economies alike
have been articulating heightened inflation concerns. consequently, there are
concerns that demand pressures, which have been reasonably contained so
far, are being coupled with supply-side factors which, if not temporary in view
of global demand-supply imbalances, could impact domestic inflation
significantly.
74. monetary and financial conditions appear to have gone through
underlying shifts in the fourth quarter of 2007-08. while the rate of money
supply has dipped from mid-february 2008 in tandem with a moderation in
the growth of time deposits, it remains high in relation to indicative projections.
on the other hand, the moderation in non-food credit growth that was evident
in the first half of 2007-08 appears to have extended into the fourth quarter of
the year. the deceleration has been marked in respect of interest-sensitive
sectors such as housing, personal loans and real estate as well as in some
categories of services such as trade, professional and other services, shipping,
transport operators, tourism, hotels and restaurants which had been recording
significantly elevated growth rates in preceding years. these movements in
banking aggregates have enabled a better balance between banks' sources
and uses of funds than before, as reflected in the decline in the incremental
non-food credit deposit ratio to below 75 per cent for the first time since
august 2004.
75. during the fourth quarter of 2007-08, financial markets were impacted
by unusual swings and high volatility in foreign exchange flows as well as in
cash balances of the government with the reserve bank with consequent
shifts in liquidity conditions. these variations were smoothened by active
liquidity management through a combination of instruments such as the mss,
the laf and the crr so that volatility in overnight interest rates was broadly
contained within the informal laf corridor. as a result, advance tax payments
did not produce the usual spikes in money market rates. generally orderly
conditions were also observed in the government securities market with some
30

widening of yield spreads across maturities on concerns about rising inflation
domestically, recent escalations in food, energy and metal prices internationally,
and the atmosphere of heightened uncertainty. in the credit market, while
deposit rates have been adjusted downwards, lending rates have edged up.
in the foreign exchange market, two-way movements in spot rates have been
in evidence in the fourth quarter of 2007-08 and in april 2008. on the other
hand, asset prices, particularly equity prices, rose to record highs in january
2008 before declining dramatically in february-march 2008.
76. finances of the central government have undergone further
consolidation in 2007-08 in consonance with the path charted under the frbm.
sustained buoyancy in corporation and personal income taxes lifted gross tax
revenues above the budgeted level by 0.8 percentage points of gdp. reflecting
the fruits of a better balancing of the tax structure, marked improvement in
compliance and efficiency gains in tax administration, the tax-gdp ratio has
moved up from 9.2 per cent in 2003-04 to 12.5 per cent in 2007-08 and is
likely to reach 13.0 per cent in 2008-09. while aggregate expenditure was
0.7 percentage points of gdp higher than budgeted, this was essentially on
account of revenue (non-plan) expenditure in the form of interest payments
and subsidies. capital expenditure, however, declined in relation to budget
estimates. there was also a sizeable recourse to mobilisation of resources
through extra-budgetary transactions in the form of issuances of securities to
public sector entities. these developments are indicative of potential pressures
in the period ahead, notwithstanding the marginal reduction achieved in the
revenue deficit and in the gross fiscal deficit in relation to gdp.
77. within india's growing integration with the global economy, some aspects
of india's external sector developments in 2007-08 merit attention. first, there
has been a sizeable widening of the trade deficit on sustained demand for
non-oil imports _ particularly for capital goods, export-related inputs and bullion
_ and as a result of escalating international crude oil prices. second, net capital
flows in april-december 2007 were 2.7 times those in april-december 2006
and 1.8 times of the net flows in the full year 2006-07. gross capital inflows to
india constituted 18 per cent of gross private capital flows to emerging and
developing economies in 2007 reported by the imf's weo. third, outward
fdi has more than doubled, reflecting the growing global reach of the indian
corporate sector. fourth, the level of reserves is currently the third largest stock
of reserves among the emes but still lower than india's international liabilities
at us $ 371 billion at book value at end-september 2007.
31

78. the global economic outlook has worsened since the third quarter
review of january 2008. until october 2007, there appeared to have been
reasonable confidence in the resilience of the world economy to cope with
the freeze in us financial markets _ world gdp growth was expected by the
imf to be 0.3 percentage points above its initial april 2007 forecast for 2007
but lower by 0.1 percentage points for 2008. since january 2008, this
confidence appears to have eroded rapidly. in april 2008, the imf's forecast
for 2008 has been lowered by 1.2 percentage points and by 1.1 percentage
points for 2009 from the april 2007 projections. risks of contagion from the
financial turmoil are regarded as high with a 25 per cent probability of it
spreading into a global recession _ world real gdp growth of 3 per cent or
less. according to the imf, a one per cent reduction in us gdp growth leads
to a 0.5 percentage points decline in growth in advanced european economies
with a six month lag, and about a 0.75 percentage points decline in the growth
of emes, taking into account the joint effect of a slowdown in the us and europe.
world trade is also expected to decelerate _ by 1.2 percentage points by the
imf and by 1.0 percentage points by the world trade organisation _ in 2008
reflecting the expectations of slower global growth.
79. globally, inflation has risen considerably from its level a year ago in
mature economies and emes alike. while the upsurge in inflation is reflected
in varying degrees in consumer prices, both headline and core, the increase
in producer prices on the back of commodity price pressures has been relatively
higher reflecting the sharp increase in input costs. the resurgence of inflation
risks worldwide from food and energy prices has also exacerbated the concerns
about slowdown in activity in the context of compressed real disposable
incomes and consumer purchasing power. other factors imparting upside
pressures to inflation are persistent strength in underlying demand, especially
from emes, and low levels of inventories. supply side pressures are expected
to persist in the coming months with considerable uncertainties surrounding
the evolution of key commodity prices and second order effects.
80.
growth forecasts for emes have been moderated in the face of the
financial turbulence and the anticipated slowdown in the us economy. the
underlying macroeconomic fundamentals of the emes remain resilient and the
robust momentum of domestic demand in large emerging economies of asia
and latin america could withstand a protracted weakening of growth in
advanced economies. they, however, remain vulnerable to negative effects in
terms of slower export growth and volatility in financial flows. furthermore,
32

asset prices have declined and equity markets in emes seem coupled and
volatile in tandem with us markets, indicating that some rebalancing is still
underway. a key risk to the outlook for emes is rising food, energy and
commodity prices that are already imparting inflationary pressures and raising
concerns about impacting the momentum of growth in these economies.
several emes are increasingly having to deal with rising public intolerance to
high food inflation which appears to be setting into a structural phenomenon
due to more frequent crop failures than before and diversion of acreage for
bio-fuels, supported in the us by fiscal subsidies. moreover, the rising
international commodity prices have impacted emes differently with commodity
exporters benefiting from sizeable terms of trade gains while commodity
importers have experienced wider trade deficits and higher domestic inflation.
finally, the recent monetary policy responses in the us have also heightened
the uncertainties facing emes by widening interest rate differentials and
increasing the costs of sterilisation, especially in a period when inflationary
pressures warrant tightening. it is in the context of these concerns that emes
have generally been reluctant to lower key policy rates in consonance with
the us. some emes have recently raised policy rates on domestic economy
considerations while the majority have kept interest rates on hold.
81. the outlook for the global financial system is overcast by the rising
incidence of losses and write-offs in banking systems in the us and europe
amidst dislocations in the securitised credit market. banks are facing capital
constraints, as credit/market risks associated with off-balance sheet investments
have to be re-intermediated. credit to housing is the worst affected. banks in
the us and europe have reported a widespread tightening in credit standards.
there are also growing uncertainties surrounding the viability of financial
guarantors and doubts about their business models as well as the approach
of rating agencies with potential systemic implications. global financial markets
have exhibited heightened uncertainty and bearish sentiment in the early
months of 2008, exacerbated by weakening macroeconomic prospects. credit
markets continue to be seized up with spreads even on investment grade
credits continuing to remain widened and those on sub-investment grade credits
at prohibitive levels. global equity markets dropped sharply in january 2008
and weakened again in march-april with volatility well above long-term
averages. in the continuing turmoil, bond markets have re-emerged as safe
havens. in the currency markets, the us dollar has been weakening against
the backdrop of monetary policy actions, already undertaken and prospective.
33

82. in the overall assessment, there have been significant shifts in both
global and domestic developments in relation to initial assessments. while
global growth was expected to moderate in the annual policy statement of
april 2007, the outlook for the global economy deteriorated from the time of
the mid-term review of october, and sharply after the third quarter review
of january 2008. the dangers of global recession have increased at the current
juncture although consensus expectations do not rule out a soft landing.
globally, inflationary pressures were evident in april 2007 in the elevated
levels of commodity and asset prices. from january 2008, the upside
pressures from international food and energy prices appear set to impart a
degree of persistent upward pressure to inflation globally. at the end of july
2007, risks from financial markets had enhanced the vulnerability of the global
financial system, with amplified exchange rate fluctuations and large changes
in the magnitude and direction of capital flows. there was growing uncertainty
as to when, how and to what extent would the withdrawal of liquidity take
place and impact economies like india. by january 2008, it was clear that the
subprime mortgage crisis carries by far the gravest risks for the world economy.
on the domestic front, the outlook remained positive up to january 2008, with
indications of moderation in industrial production, service sector activity,
business confidence and non-food credit, as anticipated. in the ensuing months,
consensus assessment of the prospects for growth in the year ahead have
been trimmed. since january 2008, risks to inflation and inflation expectations
from the upside pressures due to international food, crude and metal prices
have become more potent and real than before. volatile capital flows, large
movements in the cash balances of the government and consequent changes
in liquidity conditions continue to complicate monetary management.

ii. stance of monetary policy for 2008-09
83. the third quarter review of january 29, 2008 had noted with concern
the unfolding of global developments and the responses of monetary authorities
which seemed to provide an indication of the threat to growth and financial
stability worldwide. consequently, developments in global financial markets
in the context of the subprime crisis warranted more intensified monitoring and
swift responses with all available instruments to preserve and maintain
domestic macroeconomic and financial stability. in addition, risks to inflation
from high and volatile international prices of fuel, food and metal prices had
intensified, complicating the task of monetary authorities in assuaging liquidity
and solvency stress in financial markets and institutions. it was also indicated
34

that liquidity management will continue to assume priority in the conduct of
monetary policy. in this context, financial markets continued to be under
careful and continuous surveillance with a readiness to respond flexibly and
pre-emptively to ensure orderly liquidity conditions, particularly in the context
of the management of volatile and large movements in capital flows. against
this backdrop, it was emphasised that monetary policy has to be vigilant and
proactive in cushioning the real economy from excess volatility in financial
markets while recognising that india cannot be totally immune to global
developments. accordingly, the third quarter review reaffirmed the stance
of monetary policy set out in the annual policy statement of april 2007
and subsequent reviews of reinforcing the emphasis on price stability and
well-anchored inflation expectations while ensuring a monetary and interest
rate environment conducive to continuation of the growth momentum and
orderly conditions in financial markets. while credit quality continued to receive
priority, credit delivery, in particular, for employment-intensive sectors was
emphasised while pursuing financial inclusion. reckoning global factors as
becoming increasingly relevant even though domestic factors dominated the
policy stance, the third quarter review committed to monitor the evolving
heightened global uncertainties and the domestic situation impinging on inflation
expectations, financial stability and the growth momentum in order to respond
swiftly with both conventional and unconventional measures, as appropriate.
84. it is observed that domestic financial markets have not been seriously
impacted by the turbulence overseas, except for equity markets which have
reflected the widespread risk aversion and the increase in uncertainty in the
international financial environment. on the other hand, localised factors such
as banks' balance sheet adjustments in the run-up to the year-end closure of
accounts, advance tax flows and sizeable movements in government cash
balances produced large swings in market liquidity. consequently, the laf
switched from an absorption mode up to mid-february into persistent daily
injections during the rest of the month. in the first half of march, the laf returned
to moderate daily absorption, but switched into sizeable liquidity injections
during march 17-31, as expected. in accordance with the priority assigned to
liquidity management in the third quarter review, mss auctions were held
in abeyance from mid-february 2008 in view of the tightening of liquidity
conditions. furthermore, in pursuance of the policy of active demand
management of liquidity using all the policy instruments flexibly, including the
option to conduct overnight or longer term repo/reverse repo under laf,
additional arrangements were instituted at the request of a number of banks
35

in view of the schedule of advance tax payments in mid-march 2008 and the
subsequent bank holidays (march 20-22, 2008). as stated earlier, additional
laf operations on march 14, 17 and 31, 2008 were held to enable banks to
manage year-end liquidity conditions. mss auctions were resumed from april
9, 2008 in conjunction with laf reverse repos to manage large surpluses in
financial markets. these liquidity management operations have, by and large,
smoothed market interest rates and enabled their orderly evolution. it is
important to recognise, however, that the unwinding of the specific factors
currently in evidence will have implications for the evolution of market liquidity
in the period ahead in an environment of heightened uncertainty and volatility
in global markets and the danger of potential spillovers to domestic equity
and currency markets. against this backdrop, liquidity management will continue
to receive priority in the hierarchy of policy objectives, going forward. in
particular, the volatility in capital flows and in cash balances of the government
will continue to necessitate active liquidity management with a combination of
instruments as warranted.
85. notwithstanding the moderation in industrial activity which was
anticipated in the mid-term review and the third quarter review, the outlook
for sustaining the underlying growth momentum appears to be reasonably well
embedded into the medium-term. in the third quarter review, it was indicated
that while the moderation in private consumption expenditure merits
consideration, a disaggregate analysis of supply and demand factors across
select sectors would enable appropriate public policy responses. the recent
measures announced in the union budget 2008-09 to inter alia raise personal
disposable incomes and to reduce and rationalise excise duties reflects this
approach. institutional and procedural changes to improve credit delivery to
productive sectors, especially those with relatively higher employment intensity,
have been undertaken by the reserve bank. going forward, the combination
of these measures should provide a conducive environment for the revival of
consumption demand. investment demand is robust and likely to remain the
driving force of overall economic activity, powered by rising domestic saving,
ongoing improvement in productivity and the actualisation of the sizeable
expansion of supply capabilities that has been underway since 2003-04. at
the same time, it is important to recognise that the threats to growth and stability
from global developments have increased considerably with highly uncertain
likelihood of early resolution. besides the dangers surrounding the unfolding
of events in international financial markets referred to earlier, potential
inflationary pressures from international food and energy prices appear to have
36

amplified and, by current indications, are likely to remain so for some time.
furthermore, there is now much higher probability of a global economic and
credit slowdown than was anticipated till recently.
86. initial forecasts predict a near-normal rainfall at 99 per cent of the long
period average for the country as a whole in the 2008 south-west monsoon
season, auguring well for the sustenance of trend growth in agriculture. the
expected decline in world gdp growth in 2008 in relation to the preceding
year could temper the prospects of growth in the industrial and service sectors
at the margin although the underlying momentum of expansion in these sectors
is likely to be maintained. in view of these factors, overall, for policy purposes,
real gdp growth in 2008-09 may be placed in the range of 8.0 to 8.5 per cent,
assuming that (a) global financial and commodity markets and real economy
will be broadly aligned with the central scenario as currently assessed and
(b) domestically, normal monsoon conditions prevail.
87. in view of the lagged and cumulative effects of monetary policy on
aggregate demand and assuming that supply management would be
conducive, capital flows would be managed actively and in the absence of
new adversities emanating in the domestic or global economy, the policy
endeavour would be to bring down inflation from the current high level of above
7.0 per cent to around 5.5 per cent in 2008-09 with a preference for bringing it
as close to 5.0 per cent as soon as possible, recognising the evolving
complexities in globally transmitted inflation. the resolve, going forward, would
continue to be to condition policy and perceptions for inflation in the range of
4.0-4.5 per cent so that an inflation rate of around 3.0 per cent becomes a
medium-term objective consistent with india's broader integration into the global
economy and with the goal of maintaining self-accelerating growth over the
medium-term.
88. money supply has risen above indicative projections persistently through
2005-07 on the back of sizeable accretions to the reserve bank's foreign
exchange assets and a cyclical acceleration in credit and deposit growth,
particularly the latter, in 2007-08. in view of the resulting monetary overhang,
it is necessary to moderate monetary expansion and plan for a rate of money
supply in the range of 16.5-17.0 per cent in 2008-09 in consonance with the
outlook on growth and inflation so as to ensure macroeconomic and financial
stability in the period ahead. consistent with the projections of money supply,
the growth in aggregate deposits in 2008-09 is placed at around 17.0 per cent
37

or around rs.5,50,000 crore. based on an overall assessment of the sources
of funding and the overall credit requirements of the various productive sectors
of the economy, the growth of non-food credit including investments in bonds/
debentures/shares of public sector undertakings and private corporate sector
and commercial paper (cp) is placed at around 20.0 per cent in 2008-09
consistent with the monetary projections.
89. the escalated levels of international food and crude prices carry some
pressures for the external sector. on the whole, it is prudent to assume for
policy purposes a continued strong and sustainable external sector though
with a marginally higher order of overall trade and current account deficits in
2008-09 than in the preceding year. it is likely that net capital flows would
comfortably meet the external financing requirements in 2008-09.
90. the union budget for 2008-09 has placed the gfd at 2.5 per cent of
gdp for 2008-09, down from 3.1 per cent in the revised estimates for 2007-08
and within the frbm target. the revenue deficit has been placed at 1.0 per cent
of gdp in 2008-09, rescheduled from the target on account of enhanced
allocations for the social sector. the net market borrowing programme of the
centre for 2008-09 is budgeted at rs.99,000 crore as against rs.1,10,727 crore
in the previous year. the moderate reduction in the size of the government
borrowing programme is consistent with the path of the gfd envisaged in
the frbm.
91. fiscal developments, especially on account of evolving expenditure
commitments related to the implementation of the farm debt waiver scheme,
the recommendations of the sixth pay commission, issuance of government
bonds to oil and fertiliser companies to cover their under-recoveries/subsidy
need to be continuously monitored in view of the prevailing conditions
characterised by high and volatile global food prices and the incomplete
pass-through of the escalation of international crude prices to prices of domestic
petroleum products.
92. the heightened uncertainty surrounding global financial markets and
the unusual policy responses of major central banks provides some indications
of the threats to global growth and stability that loom over the near-term horizon.
high volatility, still frozen credit markets and massive losses suffered by large
financial institutions could impact india's external financing conditions _ trade,
capital flows and asset prices _ and, therefore, the evolving monetary policy
stance in 2008-09. while india's foreign trade is well-diversified and the reliance
38

on external finance has averaged around one per cent of gdp, domestic
activity and sentiment cannot remain immune to these developments. the major
source of the direct impact is through the financial flows, in particular, in the
equity markets and, consequently, on the foreign exchange market in india.
93. recent global developments have considerably heightened the
uncertainty surrounding the outlook on capital flows to india, complicating the
conduct of monetary and liquidity management. in view of the strong
fundamentals of the economy and massive injections of liquidity by central
banks in advanced economies, there could be sustained inflows, as in the
recent past. if the pressures intensify, it may necessitate stepped up operations
in terms of capital account management and more active liquidity management
with all instruments at the command of the reserve bank. at the same time, it
is necessary in the context of recent global events not to exclude the possibility
of reversals of capital flows due to any abrupt changes in sentiments or global
liquidity conditions. in this scenario, it is important to be ready to deal with
potentially large and volatile outflows along with spillovers. in this context,
there is headroom with the reserve bank to deal with both scenarios in terms
of the flexibility in the deployment of instruments such as the mss, the crr,
the slr and the laf for active liquidity management in both directions,
complemented by prudential regulations and instruments for capital account
management.
94. in assessing the prospects for the global economy in 2008-09, it is useful
to recognise the anticipated global slowdown and heightened uncertainties in
addition to mounting inflationary pressures. whether the slowdown would have
a moderating effect on inflationary pressures or whether the global economy
would slip into stagflation is not yet clear. inflationary pressures seem common
to the global and our domestic economy with some elements of contagion.
overall, uncertainties in regard to the indian economy, however, appear less
relative to those in the global economy and moderation in growth rather than
a significant slowdown appears likely in the case of india. in regard to the
interaction between global and national economies, some early signs of revival
of protectionism are seen globally, especially in regard to food and fuel policies.
this makes the assessment of impact of the global economy on india,
particularly in regard to inflation and capital flows, extremely difficult. however,
domestic factors will continue to dominate the policy setting, with a contextual
emphasis on inflation expectations while recognising the significance of
maintaining hard-earned gains in terms of both outcomes of and positive
sentiments on india's growth momentum.
39

95. in brief, given the unprecedented complexities involved and the
heightened uncertainties at this juncture, there are some key factors that govern
the setting of the stance of monetary policy for 2008-09. first, there is the
immediate challenge of escalated and volatile food and energy prices which
possibly contain some structural components. it is necessary, however, to
recognise that there are also cyclical components in their evolution. second,
while demand pressures persist, there has been some improvement in the
domestic supply response alongside a build-up of additional capacities, enabled
by a conducive policy environment. accordingly, even as investment demand
remains strong, supply elasticities can be expected to improve further and new
capacities should come on stream in the months ahead. third, monetary policy
has lagged and cumulative effects as demonstrated in the positive outcomes
relating to growth and stability at the current juncture, barring recent episodes
of external shocks. calibrated monetary policy actions undertaken since
september 2004 thus continue to have some stabilising influence on the
economy. further, the very recent initiatives in regard to supply-management
by the government of india and measures relating to the cash reserve ratio by
the reserve bank are in the process of impacting the economy, while a more
reliable assessment of crop prospects is underway. fourth, critical to the setting
of monetary policy is the importance of anchoring expectations relating to both
global and domestic developments. accordingly, policy responses for managing
expectations should consider the evolving global and domestic uncertainties
surrounding the slowing down of global output growth and also the potential
for exaggerated bearishness in the indian context. fifth, while monetary policy
has to respond proactively to immediate concerns, it cannot afford to ignore
considerations over a relatively longer term perspective of, say, one to two
years, with respect to overall macroeconomic prospects. at the same time, it
is critical at this juncture to demonstrate on a continuing basis a determination
to act decisively, effectively and swiftly to curb any signs of adverse
developments in regard to inflation expectations. in view of the above
unprecedented uncertainties and dilemmas, it is important to take informed
judgements with regard to the timing and magnitude of policy actions; and
such judgements need to have the benefit of evaluation of incoming information
on a continuous basis.
96. the reserve bank will continue with its policy of active demand
management of liquidity through appropriate use of the crr stipulations and
open market operations (omo) including the mss and the laf, using all the
policy instruments at its disposal flexibly, as and when the situation warrants.
40

97. in sum, barring the emergence of any adverse and unexpected
developments in various sectors of the economy, assuming that capital flows
are effectively managed, and keeping in view the current assessment of the
economy including the outlook for growth and inflation, the overall stance of
monetary policy in 2008-09 will broadly be:
●

●

●

to ensure a monetary and interest rate environment that accords
high priority to price stability, well-anchored inflation expectations
and orderly conditions in financial markets while being conducive
to continuation of the growth momentum.
to respond swiftly on a continuing basis to the evolving constellation
of adverse international developments and to the domestic situation
impinging on inflation expectations, financial stability and growth
momentum, with both conventional and unconventional measures,
as appropriate.
to emphasise credit quality as well as credit delivery, in particular,
for employment-intensive sectors, while pursuing financial inclusion.

41

iii. monetary measures
(a)
98.

the bank rate has been kept unchanged at 6.0 per cent.
(b)

99.

bank rate

repo rate/reverse repo rate

the repo rate under the laf is kept unchanged at 7.75 per cent.

100. the reverse repo rate under the laf is kept unchanged at 6.0 per cent.
101. the reserve bank has the flexibility to conduct repo/reverse repo
auctions at a fixed rate or at variable rates as circumstances warrant.
102. the reserve bank retains the option to conduct overnight or longer term
repo/reverse repo under the laf depending on market conditions and other
relevant factors. the reserve bank will continue to use this flexibility including
the right to accept or reject tender(s) under the laf, wholly or partially, if
deemed fit, so as to make efficient use of the laf in daily liquidity
management.
(c)

cash reserve ratio

103. scheduled banks are required to maintain cash reserve ratio (crr) of
7.75 per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning april 26, 2008 and 8.0
per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning may 10, 2008 as announced
on april 17, 2008. on a review of the evolving liquidity situation, it is considered
desirable to increase the crr by 25 basis points to 8.25 per cent with effect
from the fortnight beginning may 24, 2008.

first quarter review
104. the first quarter review of this part of the annual policy statement for
the year 2008-09 will be announced on july 29, 2008.

42

part ii. annual statement on developmental and
regulatory policies for the year 2008-09
105. the annual statement of april 2007 and subsequently the mid-term
review of october 2007 set the stance of developmental and regulatory
policies for the year 2007-08 in terms of emphasis on credit quality, orderly
conditions in financial markets, greater credit penetration and financial inclusion.
in the third quarter review of january 2008, heightened vigilance in the
context of potential spillovers from the global financial turbulence was accorded
priority, along with preparedness for swift responses to ensure financial stability.
during 2007-08, development of the financial market infrastructure, liberalisation
of foreign exchange transactions, strengthening risk management in banks and
supervisory processes in response to financial innovations engaged the
reserve bank, alongside the refinement of credit delivery mechanisms with
specific focus on agriculture, micro, small and medium enterprises and financial
inclusion.
106. the setting of developmental and regulatory policies for 2008-09 will
continue to focus on developing a sound, efficient and vibrant financial system
that ensures the efficient provision of financial services to the widest sections
of society. in the context of recent financial developments internationally, the
securing and maintenance of financial stability will continue to receive priority
from a policy perspective. credible communication, adequate and timely
availability of information and a broad-based, participative and consultative
approach in the conduct of its developmental and regulatory policies with
involvement of all stakeholders would shape the reserve bank's responses
to the emerging challenges.
107. recent financial developments have brought to the fore several issues
that carry implications for the health of the financial sector. first, there is close
scrutiny of the business strategies of banks and financial institutions which
are based on the model of 'originate and distribute'. second, issues relating
to securitisation are being debated in the context of incentive structures that
provide for economising on capital requirements and enhancement of off-balance
sheet exposures relative to considerations of financial soundness. third, recent
events have also underscored the need for enhanced market transparency
relating to disclosures of off-balance sheet exposures, particularly with regard
to liquidity commitments to conduits, valuations regarding structured credit
products and the like. fourth, the apparent inadequacy of financial institutions'
43

capital cushions has been exposed. in this context, the role of sovereign wealth
funds as providers of capital is being carefully assessed by supervisory
authorities across the world. fifth, the sharp repricing of risk that began in the
middle of 2007 has raised issues relating to the marking to market of portfolios
of financial institutions and attendant issues relating to capital provision. sixth,
there are concerns that existing risk pricing and management tools and
techniques employed in banks and financial institutions are inadequate in
relation to the evolving risks. seventh, there is a progressive blurring of the
boundaries between liquidity and solvency stress in situations of generalised
uncertainty and loss of confidence among financial entities. eighth, the role
of structured investment vehicles (sivs), the potential liquidity demands that
could crystallise on balance sheets and the degree of leverage embedded in
the global financial system has been largely underestimated with implications
for the soundness and efficiency of the financial sector. ninth, the functioning
of the credit rating agencies and excessive reliance of institutional investors
on the ratings are under scrutiny.
108. against this backdrop, several measures have been suggested for
mitigating the impact and improving the global financial system. according to
the institute of international finance (iif), banks should commit themselves to
follow best practices in a number of areas where the financial crisis has
revealed weaknesses. ‘best practice’ should not imply legal obligations but
high standards for entities to develop their own tailor-made solutions. the
proposals made by the financial stability forum (fsf) [a forum of select senior
representatives of national financial authorities _ including central banks,
supervisory authorities and treasury departments _ international financial
institutions, international regulatory and supervisory groupings and committees
of central bank experts] and ratified in early april 2008 by the g-7 to be
implemented over the next 100 days are comprehensive and cover full and
prompt disclosure of risk exposures, write downs and fair value estimates for
complex and illiquid instruments; urgent action by setters of accounting
standards and other relevant standard setters to improve accounting and
disclosure standards for off-balance sheet or entities and to enhance guidance
on fair value accounting, particularly on valuing financial instruments in periods
of stress; strengthening of risk management practices, supported by
supervisors' oversight, including rigorous stress testing; and strengthening of
capital positions as needed. in addition, proposals made by the fsf for
implementation by end-2008 include: strengthening prudential oversight of
capital, liquidity, and risk management under basel ii, especially for
44

complex structured credit instruments and off-balance sheet vehicles;
enhancing transparency and valuation for off-balance sheet entities,
securitisation exposures, and liquidity commitments under the basel
committee's guidance; enhancing due diligence in the use of ratings;
adherence by credit rating agencies to the revised code of conduct of the
international organisation of securities commissions (iosco); strengthening
the authorities' responsiveness to risk through cooperation and exchange of
information so as to act swiftly to investigate and penalise fraud, market abuse,
and manipulation; implementing robust arrangements for dealing with stress
in the financial system such as liquidity support from the central banks; and,
strengthening arrangements for dealing with weak and failing banks,
domestically and cross border. it may be noted that the international monetary
and financial committee (imfc) has welcomed the above policy
recommendation of fsf [the imfc is a committee of select board of
governors of the imf of which the finance minister, shri p. chidambaram is
a member].
109. in the light of the current macroeconomic environment and global
developments as discussed in part i of the statement, the annual statement
on developmental and regulatory policies focuses on certain key areas: new
financial instruments, carrying forward development of various segments of
financial markets and strengthening financial market infrastructure; developing
a safe, secure and integrated real time payment and settlement system; further
liberalisation of foreign exchange transactions; cross-border supervision,
risk-based supervision and bank-led financial conglomerates; strengthening
the supervisory framework as appropriate to evolving requirements; enhancing
public confidence and consolidation in urban cooperative banks (ucbs) and
regional rural banks (rrbs); improved credit delivery mechanisms and
conducive credit culture, customer service and financial inclusion.
110. the annual statement on developmental and regulatory policies for
the year 2008-09 is divided into four sections. i. financial markets; ii. credit
delivery mechanism and other banking services; iii. prudential measures; and
iv. institutional developments.
i. financial markets
government securities market
111. the reserve bank has taken significant steps to further broaden and
deepen the government securities market in consultation with market
participants. in this direction, the following initiatives are proposed:
45

(a)

central government securities

(i)

floating rate bonds: status

112. the mid-term review of october 2007 had indicated that a new
issuance structure for floating rate bonds (frbs) is being built into the
negotiated dealing system (nds) auction format being developed by the
clearing corporation of india limited (ccil) to simplify the methodology for
pricing of frbs in the secondary market. the ccil is currently developing
the primary auction module for the dated government securities which would
cover all types of instruments, including frbs. the issuance of frbs would
be considered at an appropriate time, taking into account the market conditions.
(ii)

ways and means advances to the
government of india: status

113. the reserve bank, in consultation with the government of india, has
retained the extant arrangements for the ways and means advances (wma)
for the fiscal year 2008-09. as per the arrangements, the wma limits would
continue to be fixed on a half-yearly basis and are placed at rs.20,000 crore
for the first half and rs.6,000 crore for the second half of 2008-09. the
applicable interest rate on wmas and overdrafts would continue to be linked
to the repo rate, as hitherto. the reserve bank, however, retains the flexibility
to revise the limits in consultation with the government of india, taking into
consideration the prevailing circumstances.
(iii)

auction process of government of india securities

114. an internal working group (chairman: shri h.r. khan) was constituted
to review the auction procedure for the government securities and make
suggestions to reduce the time taken for completion of the auction process with
a view to improving efficiency on par with the best international practices. some
of the important recommendations made by the working group include: reduction
in the time gap between bid submission and declaration of auction results;
withdrawal of the facility of bidding in physical form; submission time for the
non-competitive bids to be de-linked from that of competitive bids; competitive
bids to be submitted only through the negotiated dealing system (nds); and
designing of a secured web system facilitating direct participation of non-nds
members in the auctions of government securities. the modalities for
implementing the recommendations of the working group are being worked out.
46

(iv)

restructuring of primary dealers' activities: status

115. primary dealers (pds) were permitted in july 2006 to manage risks
inherent in their business by diversifying into other business lines, i.e.,
corporate debt, money market, equity and securitisation instruments, subject
to certain prudential limits, while retaining the requirement of predominance of
government securities business. they were also allowed to offer certain
fee-based services. pds, however, are not permitted to set up step-down
subsidiaries in order to ensure that the balance sheets of the pds do not get
affected by the spillover of risks from other businesses/subsidiaries and that
the regulation of pds is focused on their primary dealership activities. in
compliance with the guidelines, all the nine standalone pds have restructured
their operations for undertaking permissible activities.
(v)

the government securities act, 2006: status

116. the government securities (gs) act, 2006 was passed and was
published in the gazette of india on august 31, 2006 for general information.
the government securities regulations, 2007 were framed by the reserve
bank in terms of section 32(1) of the gs act, which came into force from
december 1, 2007. the main features of the regulations include investor
friendly automatic redemption facility, i.e., no physical discharge is required if
the investors submit bank account details for receiving redemption proceeds
of government security held in the form of bond ledger account (bla),
subsidiary general ledger (sgl) or stock certificate; facility of pledge,
hypothecation or lien of government security; simplified procedure for
recognition of title to a government security of a deceased holder; nomination
facility for stock certificate and blas; simplified procedure for issue of duplicate
government promissory note; and simplified procedure for making vesting
order. for better customer service, it is proposed to widely disseminate these
investor friendly features of the regulations through media publicity and the
website of the reserve bank by way of easy to understand material and
frequently asked questions (faqs).
(b)

debt management for state governments

(i)

non-competitive bidding scheme in the auctions
of the state development loans

117. the mid-term review of october 2007 indicated that a scheme for
non-competitive bidding facility in the auctions of state development loans
47

(sdls) was incorporated in the revised general notification issued by all state
governments on july 20, 2007 with a view to widening the investor base and
enhancing the liquidity of sdls. the business requirement specification relating
to this scheme has been incorporated in the dated securities auction module
of the nds auction which is being developed by the ccil. the module is
expected to become functional by september 2008.
(ii)

ways and means advances limits of the states: status

118. on a review of the state-wise limits of normal wma for the year
2007-08, the reserve bank has kept these limits unchanged for the year
2008-09. accordingly, the aggregate normal wma limit for state governments
is placed at rs.9,925 crore, including the wma limit of rs.50 crore for the
government of the union territory of puducherry. other terms and conditions
of the scheme remain unchanged.
(c)

development of market infrastructure

(i)

introduction of interest rate futures

119. a working group on interest rate futures (chairman: shri v.k. sharma)
was constituted to review the experience gained with interest rate futures since
its introduction in india in june 2003 with particular reference to product design
issues. the recommendations of the group were presented to the technical
advisory committee (tac) for money, foreign exchange and government
securities markets and their suggestions/views were taken into consideration
in the group's report which has been placed on the reserve bank's website
on march 3, 2008 for comments/suggestions. action on the recommendations
of the report would be initiated on the basis of the feedback received.
(ii)

separate trading for registered interest and
principal of securities

120. a working group (chairman: shri m.r. ramesh) comprising banks and
market participants was constituted to suggest guidelines in order to
operationalise separate trading for registered interest and principal of
securities (strips) in government securities. the working group submitted
its report which was placed on the reserve bank's website for wider
dissemination. an implementation group also examined the issue of
operationalisation of strips. with the enactment of the government securities
act, 2006 effective from december 1, 2007, it is proposed to introduce strips
48

in government securities by the end of 2008-09. the activity of stripping/
reconstitution of securities would be carried out on the public debt office
(pdo)-nds platform.
(iii)

multi-modal settlement

121. a new settlement mechanism in government securities through
settlement banks is being formulated in order to facilitate direct access of nds
and nds-om participants who do not maintain current accounts but maintain
sgl accounts with the reserve bank. this new system would facilitate phasing
out of current accounts of non-banks and non-pd entities with the reserve
bank. the ccil has developed the required software changes and has also
entered into arrangements with three banks to function as settlement banks
for the present. the new arrangement is expected to be operationalised in
may 2008.
(iv)

nds-om: extension of access through the csgl route

122. access to the order matching segment on nds (nds-om), which was
launched in august 2005, was initially allowed to commercial banks and
primary dealers and later to other nds members such as insurance companies,
mutual funds and large provident funds for their proprietary deals. access to
nds-om was extended to other entities maintaining gilt accounts with nds
members, i.e., banks and pds through the constituents’ subsidiary general
ledger (csgl) route from may 2007. initially, permission was accorded to
deposit-taking nbfcs, provident funds, pension funds, mutual funds, insurance
companies, cooperative banks, rrbs and trusts. with effect from november
2007, the facility has also been extended to the systemically important nondeposit taking nbfcs (nbfcs-nd-si). these entities can place orders on
nds-om through direct nds-om members, i.e., banks and pds, using the
csgl route. such trades are settled through the csgl account and current
account of the nds-om members.
123. certain segments of investors such as other non-deposit taking nbfcs,
corporates and fiis do not have access to nds-om through the csgl route.
in the light of requests received, it is proposed:
●

to allow these participants also to access the nds-om through the
csgl route.
49

(v)

clearing and settlement of otc
rupee interest rate derivatives

124. it was announced in the annual policy statement of may 2004 that a
clearing and settlement arrangement through the ccil was being considered
to strengthen the over-the-counter (otc) derivatives market and mitigate the
risks involved. with some of the underlying issues having been addressed
with the enactment of the payment and settlement systems act, 2007 a clearing
and settlement arrangement for otc rupee derivatives is proposed to be put
in place. the modalities for operationalising the clearing and settlement system
for the otc rupee interest rate derivatives would be worked out in consultation
with the ccil.
(d)

repo in corporate bonds

125. most of the recommendations of the high level committee on corporate
bonds and securitisation (chairman: dr. r.h. patil) have been taken up for
implementation. the union budget, 2008-09 has abolished tax deduction at
source (tds) on corporate bonds. the trading platforms started by the bombay
stock exchange (bse) and the national stock exchange (nse) have now
been in operation since july 2007. the fixed income money market and
derivatives association of india (fimmda) trade reporting platform for capturing
the otc trade data has also been operational since september 2007.
126. these initiatives will ensure development of a healthy secondary market once
there is adequate incentive for more public issuances and listing. the securities
and exchange board of india (sebi) is in the process of simplification of the issuance
procedures and rationalisation of the listing norms for corporate bonds.
127. as indicated in the mid-term review of october 2007, introduction of
repo in corporate bonds would be considered once the prerequisites viz.,
efficient price discovery through greater public issuances and secondary market
trading, and an efficient and safe settlement system based on delivery versus
payment (dvp) iii and straight through processing (stp) are met.
foreign exchange market
128. measures towards further liberalisation and improvement of foreign
exchange facilities are set out below.
50

(a)

expansion of hedging facilities

129. with a view to facilitating domestic crude oil refining companies to hedge
their commodity price risk exposures, it is proposed to:
●

●

(b)

permit domestic crude oil refining companies to hedge their
commodity price risk on domestic purchase of crude oil and sale of
petroleum products on the basis of underlying contracts which are
linked to international prices on overseas exchanges/markets.
permit domestic crude oil refining companies to hedge their
commodity price risk on crude oil imports in overseas exchanges/
markets on the basis of their past performance up to 50 per cent of
the volume of actual imports during the previous year or 50 per cent
of the average volume of imports during the previous three financial
yeas, whichever is higher. the companies will have to ensure
regularisation of the contracts booked under this facility by production
of supporting import orders during the currency of the hedge.
introduction of currency futures

130. the draft report of the internal working group on introduction of currency
futures in india (chairman: shri salim gangadharan) was placed on the
reserve bank's website on november 16, 2007. the comments received from
the public, banks, market participants, academicians and the government of
india were discussed in the meetings of the tac on money, foreign exchange
and government securities markets. taking into account the feedback and
expert views of the tac, the report has been finalised and has been placed
on the reserve bank's website on april 28, 2008. an rbi-sebi standing
technical committee has been set up to advise on operational aspects in
regard to trading of currency futures on exchanges. in consultation with the
sebi, it has been decided that currency futures will be introduced in the eligible
exchanges and the broad framework is expected to be finalised by the end of
may 2008.
(c)

overseas direct investment

131. with a view to further liberalising the policy on overseas investment, it
is proposed:
51

●

(d)

to allow indian companies to invest overseas in energy and natural
resources sectors such as oil, gas, coal and mineral ores in excess
of the current limits with the prior approval of the reserve bank.
capitalisation of export proceeds

132. in order to rationalise the policy on capitalisation of outstanding exports
and to align it with the export-import policy, it is proposed that:
●

(e)

indian parties may now approach the reserve bank for capitalisation
of export proceeds for exports outstanding beyond the prescribed
period of realisation.
liberalisation of settlement of claims relating
to export bills

133. in order to liberalise further the procedures relating to settlement of claims
in respect of export bills, it is proposed to permit authorised dealer (ad) banks
to write off, in addition to claims settled by the export credit guarantee
corporation of india (ecgc), the outstanding export bills settled by other
insurance companies which are regulated by the insurance regulatory
development authority (irda). accordingly, ad banks shall henceforth, on an
application received from the exporter, supported by documentary evidence
from the ecgc/insurance companies confirming that the claim in respect of
the outstanding bills has been settled and that the export incentives, if any,
have been surrendered, write off the relative export bills.
(f)

liberalisation of the period for realisation and
repatriation of export proceeds

134. at present, exporters are required to realise and repatriate to india the
full export value of goods or software exported within six months from the
date of export. exporters who have been certified as `status holder' in terms
of foreign trade policy, 100 per cent export-oriented units (eous) and units
set up under electronic hardware technology parks (ehtps), software
technology parks (stps) and biotechnology parks (btps) schemes are
permitted to realise and repatriate the full value of export proceeds within a
period of 12 months from the date of export. where the goods or software are
exported by the units in the special economic zones (sezs), the stipulation
of the period of realisation and repatriation to india of the full export value of
goods or software is not applicable. requests have been received to extend
52

the period of realisation of exports proceeds in view of the external environment.
it is, therefore, proposed in consultation with the government of india:
●

to enhance the present period for realisation and repatriation to india of
the full export value of goods or software exported from six months to
twelve months from the date of export, subject to review after one year.

ii. credit delivery mechanisms and
other banking services
(a)

augmenting rrbs' funds for lending to
agriculture and allied activities

135. with a view to augmenting rrbs' funds/resource base, commercial
banks/sponsor banks have been allowed to classify loans granted to rrbs
for on-lending to agriculture and allied activities as indirect finance to agriculture
in their books.
(b)

weaker sections' lending target: ensuring adherence

136. in terms of the revised guidelines on lending to priority sector effective
from april 30, 2007 domestic scbs are required to lend 40 per cent of adjusted
net bank credit (net bank credit plus investments made by banks in non-slr
bonds held in the held to maturity category) or credit equivalent of off-balance
sheet exposures, whichever is higher, to the priority sector. these scbs are
also required to lend at least 18 per cent to the agriculture sector and 10 per
cent to weaker sections covering small and marginal farmers with land holding
of five acres and less; landless labourers, tenant farmers and share croppers;
artisans, village and cottage industries where individual credit limits do not
exceed rs. 50,000; beneficiaries of swarnjayanti gram swarozgar yojana
(sgsy), swarna jayanti shahari rozgar yojana (sjsry), the scheme for
liberation and rehabilitation of scavengers (slrs) and the differential rate
of interest (dri) scheme; scheduled castes and scheduled tribes; self-help
groups (shgs); and distressed poor who have to prepay their debt to the
informal sector against appropriate collateral or group security. it has been
observed that banks have not been achieving the sub-target of 10 per cent for
lending to weaker sections. at present, domestic scbs having shortfall in the
53

priority sector lending target and/or the agriculture sub-target are allocated
amounts for contribution to the rural infrastructure development fund (ridf)
maintained with the national bank for agriculture and rural development
(nabard). it is, therefore, proposed:
●

(c)

to take into account shortfall in lending to weaker sections also for
the purpose of allocating amounts to the domestic scbs for
contribution to ridf or funds with other financial institutions as
specified by the reserve bank, with effect from april 2009.
increasing opportunities for flow of credit
to priority sectors

137. in terms of the revised guidelines on lending to the priority sector, scbs
can undertake outright purchase of any loan asset eligible to be categorised
under the priority sector from other banks and financial institutions and classify
the same under the respective categories of priority sector lending (direct or
indirect), provided the loans purchased are held at least for a period of six
months. to enable greater flow of credit to the priority sectors, it is proposed:
●

(d)

to allow rrbs to sell loan assets held by them under priority sector
categories in excess of the prescribed priority sector lending target
of 60 per cent.
simplification of lending procedures for crop loans

138. the working group (chairman: shri c.p.swarnkar) appointed by the
reserve bank and the committee on agricultural indebtedness (chairman:
dr.r.radhakrishna) appointed by the government of india made several
recommendations to address credit constraints faced by farmers, including the
issue of availability of cash throughout the year for agricultural operations. the
report of the internal working group (chairman: shri v.s.das), set up by the
reserve bank to examine the recommendations of the radhakrishna
committee, has been placed on the reserve bank's website for wider
consultation.
139. while action on the recommendation of the radhakrishna committee
will be finalised based on comments/responses received, it is proposed:
●

to ask each domestic commercial bank, including rrbs, to select
one district for introduction, on a pilot basis, of a simplified cyclical
54

credit product for farmers to enable them to continuously utilise a
core component of 20 per cent of the credit limit. this arrangement
should ensure minimum year-round liquidity as long as the interest
is serviced.
●

(e)

to introduce a simplified procedure for crop loans to landless
labourers, share croppers, tenant farmers and oral lessees whereby
banks can accept an affidavit giving details of land tilled/crops grown
by such persons for loans up to rs.50,000 without any need for
independent certification. banks could also encourage the joint
liability group (jlg)/shg mode of lending for such persons.
promotion of livelihood in the unorganised sector:
role of financial system

140. the national commission for enterprises in the unorganised sector
(chairman: dr. arjun k. sengupta) had submitted to the central government
a report on 'conditions of work and promotion of livelihood in the unorganised
sector' which had suggested a package of measures for addressing some
critical issues relating to farm and non-farm sectors. the report of the internal
working group constituted within the reserve bank to study the
recommendations of the national commission that are relevant to the financial
system and to suggest an appropriate action plan would be placed on the
reserve bank's website by may 15, 2008.
(f)

banking code for micro and small enterprises

141. in collaboration with the indian banks' association (iba), the banking
codes and standards board of india (bscbi) is evolving a banking code for
small and micro enterprises which will go a long way in empowering the sector.
(g)

working group on rehabilitation/nursing of
potentially viable sick sme units

142. as indicated in the mid-term review of october 2007, a working group
(chairman: dr.k.c.chakraborty) was constituted with representatives from
banks and the small industries development bank of india (sidbi) to examine
the feasibility of smes bringing in additional capital through alternative routes
such as equity participation and venture financing and to suggest remedial
measures for those potentially viable sick units that can be rehabilitated at the
earliest. the report of the group has been placed on the reserve bank's
website for wider dissemination/response.
55

(h)

strengthening regional rural banks and enhancement
of their operational efficiency: status

143. as indicated in the mid-term review of october 2007, a working group
(chairman: shri g.srinivasan) has been constituted with representatives from
the nabard, sponsor banks and rrbs in order to prepare rrbs to adopt
appropriate technology and migrate to core banking solutions for better
performance and improved customer services. the group is expected to submit
its report by june 30, 2008.
144. the task force for improving the operational efficiency of rrbs
(chairman: dr.k.g.karmakar), set up in 2006, had submitted its report to the
reserve bank in february 2007. while some action points have been referred
to the government of india, action has already been taken on accepted
recommendations and the remaining are under examination.
(i)

revival of rural co-operative credit structure: status

145. based on the recommendations of the task force on revival of rural
co-operative credit institutions (chairman: prof.a.vaidyanathan) and in
consultation with state governments, the government of india had approved
a package for revival of the short-term rural cooperative credit structure. so
far, 20 states (andhra pradesh, arunachal pradesh, bihar, chhattisgarh,
gujarat, haryana, jammu and kashmir, karnataka, madhya pradesh,
maharashtra, meghalaya, nagaland, orissa, punjab, rajasthan, tamilnadu,
tripura, uttarkhand, uttar pradesh and west bengal) have executed
memoranda of understanding (mous) with the government of india and the
nabard, as envisaged under the package. seven states have made
necessary amendments in their cooperative societies acts. an aggregate
amount of rs.3,325.12 crore has been released by the nabard as the
government of india's share and state governments have released their shares
to the tune of rs.333.93 crore to seven states for recapitalisation assistance
of primary agricultural credit societies (pacs).
146. implementation and monitoring of the revival package are being
overseen by the national implementing and monitoring committee (nimc) set
up by the government of india. furthermore, a study of the long-term
cooperative credit structure was entrusted to the task force by the government
of india, which had submitted its report in august 2006. it was announced in
56

the union budget 2008-09 that the central government and the state
governments have reached an agreement on the content of the package for
revival of the long-term cooperative credit structure. the cost of the package
is estimated at rs.3,074 crore, of which the central government's share will
be rs.2,642 crore.
(j)

micro-finance: status

147. the shg-bank linkage programme has emerged as the major microfinance programme in the country and is being implemented by commercial
banks, rrbs and cooperative banks. as on march 31, 2007, 28.94 lakh shgs
had outstanding bank loans of rs.12,366.49 crore. while commercial banks
accounted for 70.8 per cent of the outstanding loans, rrbs and cooperative
banks accounted for 22.7 per cent and 6.5 per cent, respectively.
148. out of 290 banks reporting data on recovery to the nabard as on
march 31, 2007, 73 per cent of banks had more than 80 per cent recovery on
loans given to shgs.
(k)

financial inclusion

(i)

pilot project of state level bankers' committees (slbcs)
for 100 per cent financial inclusion

149. so far, 277 districts have been identified for 100 per cent financial
inclusion and the target has been achieved in 134 districts in 18 states and
five union territories. notably, all districts of haryana, himachal pradesh,
karnataka, kerala, uttarakhand, puducherry, daman and diu, dadra & nagar
haveli and lakshadweep have achieved 100 per cent financial inclusion. an
evaluation of the progress made in achieving 100 per cent financial inclusion
in these districts is being undertaken to draw lessons for further action in this
regard.
(ii)

general purpose credit cards and overdrafts
against 'no-frills' account as indirect finance
to agriculture under priority sector

150. with a view to providing credit card like facilities in rural areas with
limited point-of-sale (pos) and limited automated teller machine (atm)
facilities, all scbs, including rrbs, were advised in december 2005 to
introduce a general credit card (gcc) scheme for their constituents in rural
57

and semi-urban areas, based on the assessment of income and cash flow of
the household similar to that prevailing under normal credit cards. banks also
provide a small overdraft facility against basic banking 'no-frills' accounts. at
present, 50 per cent of the credit outstanding under gcc is allowed to be
classified as indirect finance to agriculture under the priority sector. it is
proposed:
●

(iii)

to permit banks to classify 100 per cent of the credit outstanding
under gcc and overdrafts up to rs.25,000 against 'no-frills' accounts
in rural and semi-urban areas as indirect finance to agriculture under
the priority sector.
working groups on improvement of banking services
in lakshadweep, himachal pradesh and jharkhand

151. as indicated in the mid-term review of october 2007, working groups
were constituted to undertake studies of banking services in the union territory
of lakshadweep and states of himachal pradesh and jharkhand. the working
groups have submitted their reports and their recommendations have been
forwarded to the respective agencies through regional offices of the reserve
bank for implementation.
(iv)

differential rate of interest (dri) scheme:
eligibility limits raised

152. the limit of loans under the dri scheme was raised from rs.6,500 to
rs.15,000 and that of housing loans under the scheme from rs.5,000 to
rs.20,000 per beneficiary, on the basis of the announcements made in the
union budget for 2007-08. consequent upon the announcement made in the
union budget for 2008-09 the borrower's eligibility criterion in terms of annual
family income has been raised to rs.18,000 in rural areas and rs.24,000 in
urban areas.
(v)

concept paper on financial literacy and
counselling centres

153. the mid-term review of october 2007 had indicated that a concept
paper on financial literacy and counselling centres would be prepared and
placed on the reserve bank's website. accordingly, a concept paper on
financial literacy and counselling centres has been prepared and placed
58

on the reserve bank's website on april 3, 2008 for public feedback in order
to take this initiative forward.
(vi)

financial literacy

154. lack of knowledge among common persons with respect to financial
services and financial planning is a major reason for financial exclusion. the
reserve bank launched project financial literacy with a view to creating
awareness, especially among common persons, on matters relating to banking,
finance and the central bank for promoting financial inclusion. the literacy
campaign is targeted at groups such as rural folk, urban poor, school/college
children, women, senior citizens and defence personnel. a multilingual website
for common persons was launched in july 2007. this was followed by a
number of initiatives such as having a section on financial education on the
reserve bank's website, educational books for children and rural folk in the
form of comics, participation in fairs/exhibitions through educational displays/
exhibits/ interactive games. notably, the reserve bank put up an exhibition
on the evolution of banking in india since independence aboard the azadi
express, a train run by the government of india all over the country to celebrate
60 years of india's independence. the reserve bank also organised essay
competitions across the country to generate interest among the children in the
area of banking and finance. a young scholar's internship award scheme,
designed at giving opportunity to young college students to work as interns
with the reserve bank during their vacations, is under implementation.
(vii)

assistance to rrbs for adoption of ict solutions

155. as indicated in the mid-term review of october 2007, a working group
(chairman: shri g. padmanabhan) was constituted to examine providing
financial assistance to rrbs for defraying a part of their initial cost in
implementing information and communication technology (ict)-based
solutions, including installation of solar power generating devices for powering
ict equipment in remote and under-served areas. the group has since
submitted its report, which is under examination.
(viii)

ex-servicemen, retired government/bank employees
to act as business correspondents

156. in the union budget for 2008-09, the finance minister indicated that
individuals such as retired bank officers, ex-servicemen and others would be
allowed to be appointed as credit counsellors. accordingly, guidelines for
59

allowing retired bank/government employees and ex-servicemen as business
correspondents were issued on april 24, 2008.
(l)

review of lead bank scheme

157. the lead bank scheme, introduced in 1969, aimed at coordinating the
activities/efforts of banks, state governments and other developmental agencies
for promoting overall development of the rural sector. although the scheme
was reviewed in 1989 when the service area approach was adopted, there
have been significant changes in the financial system in the post-reform period.
more recently, there is increased focus on financial inclusion. at the same
time, planning has become more decentralised with greater devolution of
expenditure to the grassroots levels. in the revised context and in order to
improve the effectiveness of the scheme as announced in the mid-term
review of october 2007, a high level committee (chairperson: smt. usha
thorat) with members drawn from various financial institutions, banks and state
governments was constituted to review the lead bank scheme. the
committee has so far held seven meetings and has interacted with most of
the state governments and banks. interactions are also proposed with
academics and non-governmental organisations (ngos). the committee is
expected to submit its report by july 2008.
(m)

credit delivery, credit pricing and credit culture

158. in the mid-term review of monetary and credit policy of november
2003, the importance of adequate, timely and hassle free credit delivery,
appropriate credit pricing related to risk and a conducive credit culture was
emphasised. since then, there have been several developments including
doubling of credit to agriculture, significant rise in credit to the small and medium
enterprises (smes) sector, administered interest rates for crop loans, one time
settlement (ots) and rescheduling/restructuring schemes for distressed farmers,
simplification of procedures and other measures such as adoption of business
correspondent (bc) model and use of smart cards. the regulations under the
credit information companies act have been notified and soon new credit
information companies will be authorised to commence business. this is
expected to reduce information asymmetry and facilitate efficient credit allocation
and pricing while fostering a better credit culture. while concessional credit
and debt relief schemes are intended to alleviate farmers' distress and reopen
60

the credit lines that have been choked, sustaining an appropriate credit culture
going forward would require incentive systems for greater flow and efficient
allocation of credit. accordingly, it is proposed:
●

(n)

to set up an internal working group to look at issues relating to
credit delivery, credit pricing and credit culture in a holistic manner.
banks' services to the common person and
transparency in charges levied

159. in the last few years, the reserve bank has been focusing on
safeguarding the interest of common persons in their interface with banks while
improving the ease and efficiency of conducting banking transactions. the
measures taken by the reserve bank include setting up of the banking codes
and standards board of india, revamping the banking ombudsman scheme,
constitution of board-level customer service committees in banks, dissemination
of customer-centric information in local languages and promoting fair and
transparent policies and practices, especially in the matter of bank charges,
interest rates, customer acquisition and debt collection. banks have also
responded positively, including adoption of the code of commitment to their
customers. nevertheless, analyses of the types, frequency and trends of
complaints reaching the reserve bank and the offices of the banking
ombudsmen suggest that the essence of the code still needs to percolate
down to the level of the customer service delivery interface in banks. banks,
therefore, need to pay closer attention to these aspects, particularly, sensitivity
of the staff to meeting the legitimate expectations of customers. they also need
to ensure that they have in place effective internal arrangements for customer
grievance redressal.
160. in 2007, on account of concerns about high bank charges and excessive
interest rates in personal segment, the reserve bank laid down principles for
ensuring reasonableness of bank charges and communicating them in respect
of identified basic banking services. banks were also cautioned against
excessive interest rates, which are not sustainable and may be seen as
usurious and broad guidelines in this regard were laid down. for greater
transparency in setting interest rates banks were advised that they must use
external or market-based rupee benchmark interest rates for pricing their floating
rate loan products. the reserve bank has, thus, attempted to involve banks'
boards in implementation of various guidelines to ensure fairness,
reasonableness and transparency in bank charges for various services and
61

setting interest rates and use of external transparent benchmark for this purpose
while giving them flexibility on consideration of commercial judgement. it is
expected that banks' boards will take necessary care that these objectives are
met and need for more prescriptive regulation is avoided.
161. with a view to bringing about greater transparency, the reserve bank
is in the process of collecting details of various charges levied by banks for
public dissemination.
(o)

currency management

162. currency management continues to be guided by benchmarks set in
terms of operational efficiency and improved customer service. all currency
chest branches of banks have been equipped with note sorting machines to
ensure quality and genuineness of bank notes in circulation. these machines
segregate notes into fit and unfit categories and facilitate timely detection of
counterfeit notes. during 2007-08, soiled notes to the tune of 27 per cent of
notes in circulation were withdrawn from circulation while fresh notes to the
extent of 37 per cent were introduced with a view to ensuring adequate supply
of notes of all denominations and to improve the quality of bank notes in
circulation. in order to ensure that all bank branches provide better customer
services to members of public at bank counters for exchange of notes, it is
proposed:
●

to introduce a scheme of incentives and penalties for bank branches
(including currency chests), based on their performance in rendering
such services.
iii. prudential measures

(a)

prudential norms on income recognition, asset
classification and provisioning pertaining to advances:
infrastructure projects involving time overrun

163. in terms of the current guidelines, banks had been advised that as
regards industrial projects to be financed by them, the date of completion of
the project should be clearly spelt out at the time of financial closure of the
project and if the date of commencement of commercial production extends
62

beyond a period of six months after the date of completion of the project as
originally envisaged, the account should be treated as a sub-standard asset.
for infrastructure projects, however, the period for recognising asset impairment
was extended to one year with effect from march 31, 2007.
164. on a representation made in regard to delays in completion of
infrastructure projects for legal and other extraneous reasons, the reserve bank
undertook a review of select projects and concluded that there is merit in this
representation. accordingly, it has been decided that:
●

(b)

in case of infrastructure projects to be financed by banks, the date
of completion of the project should be clearly spelt out at the time
of financial closure of the project and if the date of commencement
of commercial production extends beyond a period of two years
(as against the current norm of one year) after the date of completion
of the project as originally envisaged, the account should be treated
as sub-standard. the revised instructions will be effective from march
31, 2008.
off-balance sheet exposures of banks

165. the reserve bank has, in the light of domestic developments, taken
steps to strengthen the prudential framework in respect of on-balance sheet
exposures of banks. such measures included additional risk weights and
provisioning requirements for exposures to specific sectors. in view of the recent
developments in the global financial markets and drawing from suggestions
for ensuring financial stability, it is proposed:
●

to review current stipulations regarding conversion factors, risk
weights and provisioning requirements for specific off-balance sheet
exposures of banks and prescribe prudential requirements as
appropriate. the guidelines in this regard would be placed on the
reserve bank's website by may 15, 2008.

166. in view of the risks associated with international financial developments
impacting the balance sheets of corporates and banks, the third quarter
review of january 2008 had urged banks to review large foreign currency
exposures and put in place a system for monitoring such unhedged exposures
on a regular basis so as to minimise risks of instability in highly uncertain
conditions. banks were also urged to carefully monitor corporate activity in
63

terms of treasury/trading activity and sources of other income to the extent that
embedded credit/market risks pose potential impairment to the quality of banks'
assets.
167. the reserve bank has also issued comprehensive guidelines on
derivatives laying down broad generic principles for undertaking all derivative
transactions, management of risks and sound corporate governance
requirements as also adoption of suitability and appropriateness policy. banks
and their clients who have scrupulously followed the extant guidelines,
including the regulations framed under the fema, both in letter and spirit,
would be well equipped to meet any potential consequences.
(c)

review of loans to commodities sector by banks

168. in view of the current public policy concerns in regard to trading in food
items, banks are required to review their advances to traders in agricultural
commodities including rice, wheat, oilseeds and pulses as also advances
against warehouse receipts. they are further advised to exercise caution while
extending such advances to ensure that bank finance is not used for hoarding.
the first such review should be completed by may 15, 2008 and forwarded to
the reserve bank for carrying out supervisory review of banks' exposure to
the commodity sector.
(d)

prudential norms for housing

169. on a review of recent developments, it has been decided to enhance
the limit of rs.20 lakh to rs.30 lakh in respect of bank loans for housing in
terms of applicability of risk weights for capital adequacy purposes.
accordingly, such loans will carry a risk weight of 50 per cent.
(e)

credit information companies

170. the reserve bank had issued a press release on april 18, 2007 inviting
applications from companies interested in continuing/commencing the business
of credit information. the last date for submission of such applications was
july 31, 2007. in response, 13 applications have been received. an external
high level advisory committee (hlac) (chairman: dr.r.h.patil) has been
set up by the reserve bank for screening the applications and recommending
the names of the companies to which certificates of registration can be granted
by the reserve bank. after the announcement of the fdi policy for credit
64

information companies, the processing of applications has been taken up and
the reserve bank would complete the process by june 30, 2008.
(f)

three-track approach for basel ii

171. the reserve bank has adopted a three-track approach to capital
adequacy regulation in india with the norms stipulated at varying degrees of
stringency for different categories of banks given the variations in size, nature
and complexity of operations and relevance of different types of banks to the
indian financial sector, the need to achieve greater financial inclusion and to
provide an efficient credit delivery mechanism. accordingly, commercial banks,
which account for a major share in the total assets of the banking system and
are basel ii standards compliant, would be on track i, banks which are
basel i compliant would be on track ii and banks which are in the nature of
local community banks would be on track iii.
172. an internal technical group (chairman: shri prashant saran) has been
constituted to propose criteria for the applicability of basel norms to state
cooperative banks/district central cooperative banks/rrbs. the group is
expected to submit its report by june 30, 2008.
(g)

cross-border supervision

173. the mid-term review of october 2007 proposed to constitute a
working group to lay down the road-map for adoption of a suitable framework
for cross-border supervision and supervisory cooperation with overseas
regulators, consistent with the framework envisaged in the basel committee
on banking supervision (bcbs). accordingly, an internal working group
(chairman: shri s.karuppasamy) has been constituted which is currently
studying the cross-country practices, including the legal issues in this regard.
(h)

consolidated supervision and financial conglomerates

174. the mid-term review of october 2007 proposed to integrate the process
of consolidated supervision with the financial conglomerate monitoring
mechanism in order to enhance the effectiveness of the banking supervisory
system for bank-led conglomerates. accordingly, realignment of various internal
supervisory processes for implementing an enhanced consolidated supervision
process would be completed by august 31, 2008.
65

(i)

supervisory review process on activities of the
trusts/spvs set up by banks

175. special purpose vehicles (spvs) and trusts are set up by banks to
carry out a number of activities such as facilitating securitisation, asset
management and investing in other entities. these entities are generally
unregulated and are subject to inadequate independent board oversight.
besides, the downstream activities of these entities are normally not captured
in the financial statements of the bank. as the activities of these entities could
be a potential risk to the parent bank and could also pose systemic risk, there
is a need for placing them under suitable supervisory oversight. accordingly,
it is proposed:
●

(j)

to constitute a working group to study and recommend a suitable
supervisory framework for activities of spvs/trusts set up by banks.
new model of risk-based supervision: evolution

176. risk-based supervision (rbs) was introduced on a pilot basis in eight
selected banks in 2003-04, which was extended to 15 banks in 2004-05, four
more banks in 2005-06 and eight more banks in 2006-07. on the basis of the
experience gained from these pilot runs and with a view to evolving an
appropriate model of rbs, a departmental group has been set up to study
international practices on such systems. the study would focus on impact
assessment, periodic reviews of horizontal risks across the system, inclusion
of supervisory review process prescribed under pillar 2 of basel ii framework
in the rbs assessment, simplification of the existing system of risk profiling
and would recommend an appropriate rbs framework with a view to integrating
the rbs system with the existing supervisory process based on capital
adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and systems
(camels) evaluation.
(k)

overseas operations of indian banks: review of
existing off-site monitoring framework

177. in view of the rapid expansion of overseas operations, introduction of
new products and processes, increasing off-balance sheet exposures
including derivative products, a need has arisen for a review of the reporting
system. accordingly, an inter-departmental group has been constituted to
review the existing regulatory and supervisory framework for overseas
66

operations of indian banks and recommend appropriate changes, including
off-site reporting systems.
(l)

financial stability forum (fsf) report: status

178. as already mentioned, in the wake of the turmoil in global financial
markets, the fsf brought out a report in april 2008 identifying the underlying
causes and weaknesses in the international financial markets. the report
contains, inter alia, proposals of the fsf for implementation by end-2008
regarding strengthening prudential oversight of capital, liquidity and risk
management, enhancing transparency and valuation, changing the role and
uses of credit ratings, strengthening the authorities' responsiveness to risk and
implementing robust arrangements for dealing with stress in the financial
system. the reserve bank had put in place regulatory guidelines covering
many of these aspects, while in regard to others, actions are being initiated.
in many cases, actions have to be considered as work in progress. in any
case, the guidelines are aligned with global best practices while tailoring them
to meet country-specific requirements at the current stage of institutional
developments. the proposals made by the fsf and status in regard to each
in india are narrated below:
1.

strengthened prudential oversight of capital,
liquidity and risk management

(i)

capital requirements:
specific proposals will be issued in 2008 to:

●

●

●

raise basel ii capital requirements for certain complex structured
credit products;
introduce additional capital charges for default and event risk in the
trading books of banks and securities firms;
strengthen the capital treatment of liquidity facilities to off-balance
sheet conduits.

changes will be implemented over time to avoid exacerbating short-term
stress.
67

(ii)

liquidity:

supervisory guidance will be issued by july 2008 for the supervision and
management of liquidity risks.
(iii)

oversight of risk management:

guidance for supervisory reviews under basel ii will be developed that will:
●

●

●

strengthen oversight of banks' identification and management of
firm-wide risks;
strengthen oversight of banks' stress testing practices for risk
management and capital planning purposes;
require banks to soundly manage and report off-balance sheet
exposures;

supervisors will use basel ii to ensure banks' risk management, capital buffers
and estimates of potential credit losses are appropriately forward looking.
(iv)

over-the-counter derivatives:

authorities will encourage market participants to act promptly to ensure that
the settlement, legal and operational infrastructure for over-the-counter
derivatives is sound.
179. the road-map for the implementation of basel ii in india has been
designed to suit the country-specific conditions. the phased implementation
process got underway with the basel ii accord being made applicable to foreign
banks operating in india and indian banks having operational presence outside
india with effect from march 31, 2008. all other commercial banks (except local
area banks and rrbs) are encouraged to migrate to basel ii in alignment
with them but in any case not later than march 31, 2009. the process of
implementation is being monitored on an on-going basis for calibration and
fine-tuning.
180. the minimum capital to risk-weighted asset ratio (crar) in india is
placed at 9 per cent, one percentage point above the basel ii requirement.
further, regular monitoring of banks' exposure to sensitive sectors and their
liquidity position is also undertaken. in india, off-balance sheet vehicles in the
form of spvs for the purpose of securitisation are in existence for which
68

extensive guidelines, in line with the international best practices, have already
been issued. liquidity facilities to such spvs are subject to capital charge.
banks have been required to put in place appropriate stress test policies and
relevant stress test frameworks for various risk factors by march 31, 2008.
181. in order to further strengthen capital requirements, it has been decided
to review the credit conversion factors, risk weights and provisioning
requirements for specific off-balance sheet items including derivatives. further,
in india, complex structures like synthetic securitisation have not been permitted
so far. introduction of such products, when found appropriate, would be guided
by the risk management capabilities of the system.
182. the reserve bank had issued broad guidelines for asset-liability
management and banks have flexibility in devising their own risk management
strategies as per board-approved policies. however, in regard to liquidity risks
at the very short end, the reserve bank has taken steps to mitigate risks at
the systemic level and at the institution level as well. the reserve bank has
introduced greater granularity to measurement of liquidity risk by splitting the
first time bucket (1-14 days, at present) into three time buckets, viz., next day,
2-7 days and 8-14 days. the net cumulative negative mismatches in the three
time buckets have been capped at 5 per cent, 10 per cent, 15 per cent of the
cumulative cash outflows.
183. the reserve bank had recognised the risks of allowing access to
unsecured overnight market funds to all entities and, therefore, restricted the
overnight unsecured market for funds only to banks and primary dealers (pd).
since august 2005, the overnight call market is a pure inter-bank market.
accordingly, trading volumes have shifted from the overnight unsecured market
to the collateralised market.
184. greater inter-linkages and excessive reliance on call money borrowings
by banks could cause systemic problems. the reserve bank has, therefore,
introduced prudential measures to address the extent to which banks can
borrow and lend in the call money market. on a fortnightly average basis, call
market borrowings outstanding should not exceed 100 per cent of capital funds
(i.e., sum of tier i and tier ii capital) in the latest audited balance sheet.
185. recognising the potential of 'purchased inter-bank liabilities' (ibl)
to create systemic problems, the reserve bank had issued guidelines in
69

march 2007 prescribing that ibl of a bank should not exceed 200 per cent of
its net worth (300 per cent for banks with a crar more than 11.25 per cent).
2.

enhancing transparency and valuation

(i)

robust risk disclosures:

●

●

(ii)

●

●

(iii)

the fsf strongly encourages financial institutions to make robust
risk disclosures using leading disclosure practices at the time of their
mid-year 2008 reports.
further guidance to strengthen disclosure requirements under pillar
3 of basel ii will be issued by 2009.
standards for off-balance sheet vehicles and valuations:
standard setters will take urgent action to:
improve and converge financial reporting standards for off-balance
sheet vehicles;
develop guidance on valuations when markets are no longer active,
establishing an expert advisory panel in 2008.
transparency in structured products:

market participants and securities regulators will expand the information
provided about securitised products and their underlying assets.
186. the reserve bank has, over the years, issued guidelines on valuation
of various instruments/assets in conformity with the international best practices
while keeping india-specific conditions in view. in order to encourage market
discipline, the reserve bank has developed a set of disclosure requirements
which allow the market participants to assess key pieces of information on
capital adequacy, risk exposure, risk assessment processes and key business
parameters which provide a consistent and understandable disclosure
framework that enhances comparability. banks are also required to comply
with the accounting standard (as) on disclosure of accounting policies issued
by the institute of chartered accountants of india (icai).
187. in recognition of the fact that market discipline can contribute to a safe
and sound banking environment and as part of the ongoing efforts to implement
70

the basel ii accord, the reserve bank issued guidelines on minimum capital
ratio (pillar 1) and market discipline (pillar 3) in april 2007 and guidelines for
pillar 2 (supervisory review process) were issued in march 2008. under these
guidelines, non-compliance with the prescribed disclosure requirements would
attract a penalty, including financial penalty.
3.

changes in the role and uses of credit ratings

credit rating agencies should:
●

●

implement the revised iosco code of conduct fundamentals for
credit rating agencies to manage conflicts of interest in rating
structured products and improve the quality of the rating process;
differentiate ratings on structured credit products from those on bonds
and expand the information they provide.

regulators will review the roles given to ratings in regulations and
prudential frameworks.
188. the reserve bank has undertaken a detailed process of identifying the
eligible credit rating agencies whose ratings may be used by banks for
assigning risk weights for credit risk. banks should use the chosen credit rating
agencies and their ratings consistently for each type of claim, for both risk
weighting and risk management purposes. banks are not allowed to ‘cherry
pick’ the assessments provided by different credit rating agencies. if a bank
has decided to use the ratings of some of the chosen credit rating agencies
for a given type of claim, it can use only the ratings of those credit rating
agencies, despite the fact that some of these claims may be rated by other
chosen credit rating agencies whose ratings the bank has decided not to use.
external assessments for one entity within a corporate group cannot be used
to risk weight other entities within the same group.
189. banks must disclose the names of the credit rating agencies that they
use for the risk weighting of their assets, the risk weights associated with the
particular rating grades as determined by the reserve bank through the
mapping process for each eligible credit rating agency as well as the
aggregated risk weighted assets as required.
71

190. in india, complex structures like synthetic securitisations have not been
permitted so far. as and when such products are to be introduced, the reserve
bank would put in place the necessary enabling regulatory framework,
including calibrating the role and capacity building of the rating agencies.
4.
●

strengthening the authorities' responsiveness to risks
a college of supervisors will be put in place by end-2008 for each
of the largest global financial institutions.

191. in the indian context, there have been exchange of supervisory
information on specific issues between the reserve bank and few other
overseas banking supervisors/regulators. supervisory cooperation has been
working smoothly and efficiently.
192. the mid-term review of october 2007 had announced the constitution
of a working group to lay down a road-map for adoption of a suitable
framework for cross-border supervision and supervisory cooperation with
overseas regulators, consistent with the framework envisaged in the basel
committee on banking supervision (bcbs). a working group has been
constituted in march 2008 and would complete the work by august 2008. a
number of overseas regulators of countries such as the usa, the uk, canada,
hong kong, australia and singapore have been formally approached to share
systems and practices, including legal positions, in the matter of supervisory
cooperation and sharing of information with overseas regulators. the response
from a few countries has been received and is being examined. the
'supervisory college' arrangement for this purpose is also being examined by
the group.
5.

●

robust arrangements for dealing with
stress in the financial system
central banks will enhance their operational frameworks and
authorities will strengthen their cooperation for dealing with stress.

193. in the reserve bank, there is an institutional arrangement in place to
oversee the functioning of the financial markets on a daily basis. there is a
financial market committee monitoring and assessing the functioning of
different financial markets. based on such an oversight, appropriate and prompt
action is taken, whenever necessary.
72

194. the reserve bank has the necessary framework for provision of liquidity
to the banking system, in terms of sections 17 and 18 of the reserve bank of
india act, 1934. the regular liquidity management facilities of the reserve
bank include the laf, omo and mss besides standing facilities such as export
credit refinance (ecr) and the liquidity facility for standalone pds. the reserve
bank can undertake purchase/sale of securities of the central or state
governments and can purchase, sell and rediscount bills of exchange and
promissory notes drawn on and payable in india and arising out of bona fide
commercial or trade transactions for provision/absorption of liquidity for normal
day-to-day liquidity management operations as also for provision of emergency
liquidity assistance to the banks under the lender of last resort function.
195. the reserve bank is empowered under the existing legal framework to
deal with the resolution of weak and failing banks. the banking regulation
act provides the legal framework for voluntary amalgamation and compulsory
merger of banks under sections 44 (a) and 45, respectively. the deposit
insurance and credit guarantee corporation (dicgc) offers deposit insurance
cover in india. the mergers of many weak private sector banks with healthy
banks has improved overall stability of the system. not a single scheduled
commercial bank in the country has capital adequacy ratio which is less than
the minimum regulatory requirement of nine per cent.
iv. institutional developments
payment and settlement systems
(a)

payment and settlement systems act, 2007

196. the payment and settlement systems bill was passed by the parliament
and became an act known as 'payment and settlement systems act, 2007'
after receiving the assent of the president on the december 20, 2007. the
act empowers the reserve bank to regulate and supervise the payment and
settlement systems in the country; gives it authority to permit the setting up/
continuance of such systems and to call for information/data and issue
directions from/to payment system providers. the act defines a payment system
and gives legal recognition to multilateral netting and settlement finality.
accordingly, the reserve bank has placed the draft regulations under the
payment and settlement systems act, 2007 on its website inviting public
73

comments to be received latest by may 15, 2008. the regulations will be
finalised in consultation with the government of india.
(b)

it-based financial inclusion products and services

197. information technology (it) has enhanced the scope of financial
inclusion with low cost technology by reaching out to hitherto unexplored
sectors of the economy. the usage of card-based products for multiple
applications is cost-effective and holds potential for large-scale deployment.
with a wide range of it-based products such as smart cards, hand held devices
and secured message transfers, there is an imperative need to ensure that
these instruments blend seamlessly with the existing operative systems at the
bank level. accordingly, banks are urged to ensure that security of banking
transactions is adequately addressed while using such products.
(c)

real time gross settlement (rtgs):
compliance with the core principles

198. the rtgs system implemented by the reserve bank has been in
operation for nearly four years. the system has also stabilised over the years
and has been witnessing increased coverage in terms of bank branches and
transaction volume. the bank for international settlements (bis) has published
a set of core principles in 2001 which are in the nature of standards to
measure the efficiency of the systemically important payment systems and the
reserve bank has been assessing the compliance of the indian rtgs system
with these principles on annual basis. as per the latest review, the system is
fully compliant with six core principles, broadly compliant with three, and one
principle is not applicable for the indian rtgs system. out of the four
responsibilities of the central bank under the core principles, full compliance
has been achieved in respect of two core principles, broad compliance with
one and one responsibility is not applicable in the indian context.
(d)

electronic payment products: status

199. the coverage of the rtgs system has increased significantly. by
march 31, 2008 rtgs connectivity was available in more than 43,500 bank
branches. the reserve bank continues to improve the quality of services
through the rtgs.
74

200. the launch of the pilot project for cheque truncation system, which
aims at enhancing efficiency in the retail cheque clearing section, has become
operational from february 1, 2008 in 10 banks.
201. the committee (chairman: dr.r.b.barman), constituted for introduction
of the national settlement system (nss), examined various models and
recommended the centralised funds transfer system (cfts) model for
implementation. under the cfts model, banks would be able to transfer funds
across all deposit accounts departments (dads) on real time basis. so far,
cfts has been implemented at 16 centres.
202. the electronic clearing service (ecs), which facilitates bulk payments,
is currently available at 68 centres. the mid-term review of october 2007
had proposed to operationalise the national electronic clearing service (necs)
using the existing infrastructure of national electronic funds transfer (neft)
system with a view to widening the geographical coverage of the ecs in
consultation with banks. software development and testing has been completed
for the first phase covering the existing ecs centres and the testing report
has been approved for implementation.
203. considering that the potential for a shift from paper-based system to
electronic system is large, the processing charges for ecs / eft / neft were
waived up to march 31, 2008. the reserve bank, in its role as promoter and
facilitator of electronic funds transfer would like to continue this approach for
one more year. accordingly, the processing charges for all electronic payment
products, viz., ecs, eft, neft and rtgs are waived for another year i.e.,
up to march 31, 2009.
(e)

regulatory guidelines: mobile payments

204. the reach of mobile phones has been increasing at a rapid pace in
india. there were about 231 million mobile phone connections in the
country at the end of december 2007. the rapid expansion of this mode
of communication has thrown up a new payment delivery channel for
banks. many countries in the world have adopted this mode of delivery to
successfully spread the reach of the banking facility to the remote parts
of their respective countries. this channel facilitates small value payments
to merchants, utility service providers and the like and money transfers at
a low cost.
75

205. the reserve bank is in the process of formulating the regulatory
guidelines for mobile payments systems in india and is in discussion
with banks, service providers and industry bodies for this purpose. the
draft guidelines will be placed on the reserve bank's website by june
15, 2008.
(f)

electronic based social security payments

206. the report of the committee (chairman: dr.r.b.barman), set up by the
reserve bank to examine matters relating to electronic based payments by
the central and state governments under various social welfare schemes like
social security pension payment, national rural employment guarantee
scheme (nregs) and insurance scheme for persons living below the poverty
line, has been placed on the reserve bank's website.
(g)

migration from paper based payment systems to
electronic payment systems: mandating

207. the reserve bank has been continuously taking initiatives to migrate
from paper-based payment to electronic payment systems by creating the
appropriate technological infrastructure. in this context, an internal group was
constituted to examine various issues connected with the use of electronic
payment systems. based on the group's report, an approach paper was placed
on the reserve bank's website inviting comments/suggestions from the public.
on the basis of the feedback, effective from april 1, 2008 all payment
transactions of rs. one crore and above in the money, government securities
and foreign exchange markets and the regulated entities (banks, pds and
nbfcs) have been made mandatory to be routed through the electronic
payment mechanism.
(h)

eligibility criteria for access to payment systems

208. an internal working group, constituted to prepare comprehensive draft
guidelines on minimum eligibility criteria for direct members of the clearing
houses, submitted its report in september 2007 which was placed on the
reserve bank's website for public comments. final guidelines in this connection
have been made effective from january 1, 2008 and banks have been advised
to implement these guidelines.
76

urban cooperative banks
(a)

creation of umbrella organisation and revival fund for
urban cooperative banks: setting up of a working group

209. the working group (chairman: shri n.s.vishwanathan), constituted to
explore various options and alternate instruments/avenues for raising of
regulatory capital funds of urban cooperative banks (ucbs), observed that
creating a legal framework for facilitating the emergence of umbrella
organisation(s) like those prevalent in other parts of the world appears to be
the only long-term solution for raising of capital in the ucb sector. there have
also been requests from the sector for creation of a revival/liquidity support
fund. accordingly, it is proposed:
●

(b)

to constitute a working group comprising representatives of the
reserve bank, central/state governments and the ucb sector to
suggest measures, including the appropriate regulatory and
supervisory framework, to facilitate emergence of umbrella
organisation(s) for the ucb sector in the respective states.
opening of on-site atms by ucbs: liberalisation

210. at present, ucbs are allowed to open on-site atms subject to certain
eligibility norms, including minimum deposit criterion of rs.100 crore. with a
view to liberalising this facility, it is proposed:
●

(c)

to dispense with the extant eligibility norms for opening on-site atms
for well-managed and financially sound ucbs in the states that have
signed mous with the reserve bank and those registered under
the multi-state cooperative societies act, 2002.
branch licensing norms: liberalisation

211. as proposed in the annual policy statement of april 2007, well-managed
and financially sound ucbs in states that have signed mous with the reserve
bank and those registered under the multi-state cooperative societies act,
2002 were permitted to open branches and extension counters subject to
fulfilling certain eligibility criteria. with a view to liberalising and rationalising
the branch licensing norms for such ucbs, it is proposed:
●

to consider approvals for branch expansion, including off-site atms,
based on annual business plans, subject to maintenance of minimum
crar of 10 per cent on a continuing basis and other regulatory comfort.
77

(d)

insurance business by ucbs: liberalisation of norms

212. at present, ucbs registered in states that have signed mous with the
reserve bank or registered under the multi-state cooperative societies act,
2002 with a minimum net worth of rs.10 crore are permitted to undertake
insurance business as corporate agents without risk participation, subject to
certain conditions. taking into consideration the representations from ucbs, it
is proposed:
●

(e)

to dispense with the minimum net worth criterion for undertaking
such insurance business provided other criteria as prescribed from
time to time are met.
individual housing loan: enhancement of limit

213. as per extant norms, ucbs can grant housing loans to individuals up
to a maximum of rs.25 lakh. based on the representations made by ucbs, it
is proposed:
